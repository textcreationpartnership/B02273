            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>THeſe Lines are to give thee a brief account of the occaſion of this enſuing diſcourſe. There being ſome things in my Book, titled <hi>The Body of Divinity, or a Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to the Perſon of the Son of God, with ſome other things, at which ſome take Offence, and leſt others might do the ſame, I thought it neceſſary to ſay ſomething in way of further clearing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the matters ſtumbled at, though (in my underſtanding) it was fully clear before, it being a matter of that weight (if I miſtake not) that greatly concerns Chriſtians to be inſtructed and eſtabliſhed in; though in it ſelf an unſearchable myſtery; yet that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, and the Son of man in one Perſon; that the ſame, who is ths Son of God, is the Son of man; and the ſame Jeſus, who is the Son of Man, is the Son of God, and was ſo (as to the Father) from Eternity; the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever; the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the firſt and the laſt; for which, there is ſo great a cloud of Witneſſes (as you may find in the enſuing diſcourſe) not one or two, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it hath the Volum of the book of God for its Teſtimony: So that I fear ſome perſons read more to find oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of Offence, to make Contentions, than for Edification; or elſe they would not ſtumble where is no ſtumbling ſtone. I would willingly hope that there are but few who profeſs to own Chriſt to be the Son of God, but do believe him to be ſo, as he was born of a Woman, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. the ſame which the Scripture declares him to be: and as for my ſelf, I muſt profeſs I know nor believe in any other: but here I ſhall ſay no more of this matter, leaving the Reader to the enſuing diſcourſe, deſiring him to Read, and impartially ponder what is further ſaid.</p>
                  <p>And as for the other things that are briefly, yet plainly diſcourſed, moſt of them were hinted at in my Book, but not ſo plain as in this; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I thought not to ſpeak my apprehenſions in theſe matters ſo plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling to offend any; but having the occaſion of writing, as but now expreſt, &amp; meeting with Convictions for not Anſwering my Light and Conſcience in theſe matters, it being (in my underſtanding) of weighty concernment to the Name of God, the Goſpel of his Grace, and the good of all men; hence I thought it better to diſcharge my Conſcience towards
<pb facs="tcp:175804:3"/> God, than remain under the guilt of hiding Truth within me; I can ſay that in theſe matters I thought to have been dumb and ſilent, but it burned within me, and at laſt it burſt out, and I hope not in vain; but if ſeriouſly and ſoberly pondered, inſtead of being an occaſion of ſtumbling, or offence to any, it will prove a bleſſed means of removing ſome ſtumblings and offences out of the way, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite Chriſtians in the truth of the Goſpel; though I am not forgetful that I muſt expect (by ſome) to be judged and cenſured as affecting ſingularity; but that I value not, let Truth take place; though I paſs under Reproach for Truths ſake, it matters not to me, though I truſt my deſign is not fleſhly ſingularity, or eſteem with men: no, this is not the way for that: But to be ſingular for God and Truth, is not only my duty, but the duty and concernment of all Chriſtians, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 46, 47. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 9, 10. And O that we were all more ſingular in this matter.</p>
                  <p>Its true, I muſt ſay that I have not followed Authors, nor pinned my Faith on the judgment of any; nor have I followed cunning deviſed fables, but ſingly ſearched the Scriptures (following the Lords teachings therein) which are able to make us wiſe to Salvation, through Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>and to build us up, and give us an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among the Sanctified ones,</hi> Act 20. 32.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude, I am not willing to have any offended at any thing in the following diſcourſe, and to that end, do deſire the Reader to read and ponder well, and to ſearch the Scriptures, and ſee whether thoſe things be ſo; laying aſide all prejudice againſt the things, or the Author, exerciſing the underſtanding with an unballanced and unprejudiced mind, looking to the Lord for direction. And if after all, any thing ſeem dark or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, lay it aſide, and be ſure it will not harm thee, unleſs it be in the loſs of Truth, if ſo it be, I deſire the Lord to direct in all things, and to follow all ſincere and right endeavours for his Name and Honour, the Goſpel and good of ſouls with his bleſſing, and do pray him to follow this with his bleſſing for good. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>THeſe things (I think) are all ſtated and cleared in the firſt Chapter, without all juſt occaſion of offence; I ſhall not ſay much of the ungrounded Arguments againſt them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as yet private, but what is neceſſary for the more full confirmation of the things as ſtated in that Chapter.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That He is not the Son of God in the divine Nature only.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My reaſon for this is, becauſe the Scripture, no where (that I know) affirms him ſo to be; and for me or any other to affirm that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:175804:4"/> which the Scripture doth not, muſt needs be unſound and unſafe. The Scripture, always, when it ſpeaks of the Son of God, it is as he was in both Natures, God and Man; and hence its ſafe to ſay, that he was not the Son of God in the Divine Nature only.</p>
                     <p>That which I ſhall endeavour to demonſtrate from Scripture, is, that he is the Son of God only, as conſidered in both Natures, which is the ſecond Exception; and if this be proved, then the firſt is true, <hi>(viz.)</hi> If he be the Son of God in both Natures only, then he is not the Son of God in the Divine Nature only; and to prove that he is the Son of God in both Natures only, the Scripture ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents him to us, and no otherwiſe; and as the Scriptures preſents him to us, ſo ought we to believe him to be, and no otherwiſe; but that the Scriptures do thus preſent Chriſt unto us, and no otherwiſe, appeareth.</p>

The Scriptures that ſpeak of Chriſt, as in the Boſom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before time, ſpeak of him as he came forth in time, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1, 2. the ſame word it was, that <hi>was in the beginning with God,</hi> that in time <hi>was made fleſh and dwelt among us,</hi> v. 14. and his glory was ſeen and beheld, which was not the Divine Nature only, that only was never ſeen nor beheld of any, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 29. ſpeaking of Chriſt as with the Father, in his fore-knowing and electing grace to men, ſaith, That they were <hi>predeſtinated to be conformed to the Image of his Son.</hi> Here the Son is conſidered as at the bottom of Electing grace, and this ſurely muſt be before the world was; then let us ſeriouſly conſider, whether it was as God only, or as Man only. 1. Not as God only, for this the Oppoſers will not grant; that as the Son in the Divine Nature only, he was the Firſt-born among many Brethren, for ſo he could have no Brother, then it muſt be as God and Man, as in time he was made manifeſt, and as antiently ſo conſidered by and with the Father, as the fore-knowing and predeſtinating Grace of God to men, though not ſo frequently made known by the name or title of the Son of God, till made ſieſh, but <hi>the word of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 1, 2. Pſal. 33. 6. and Eph. 1. 4. God choſe in Chriſt before the world was, and as Chriſt the Anointed, he was the Son of God, and the Son of Man: and is it poſſible for us to have right thoughts of Chriſt in this choyce, and yet to ſuppoſe him not to be in any true Scripture-ſence with the Father, as Chriſt the Son of God and Man in this choyce? For he was not Chriſt in the divine Nature only, nor in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature only; ſo to underſtand him, tends to Un chriſt, and ſo to Un-ſon him as truly as any notion whatſoever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 6, 7.

                     <p>Let theſe Scriptures (among many) ſuffice to prove that Chriſt conſidered from Eternity was the ſame, as when manifeſt in time, relative to the Father, the ſame Son of God in both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Scriptures that fore-tell of him before he was come in fleſh, ſo ſpeak of him, as to come <hi>(viz.)</hi> as God and Man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>The Womans Seed that was to bruiſe the Scrpents head,</hi> was not the Divine Nature only; for that only could not be the Womans Seed; nor the Humane Nature only; for that could not bruiſe the Serpents head, nor accompliſh the work deſigned; therefore it muſt be Chriſt, God, and Man, as he came forth in time, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. with 22. 18. <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8, 16.

                        <p>This Scripture no way makes againſt, but confirms the Truth as it is by me aſſerted. That neither Chriſt did intend, nor the Jews underſtand, that he intended himſelf to be the Son of God in the Divine Nature only, is moſt apparent both from the Text and Context.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That Chriſt did not ſo intend, is apparent. 1. Becauſe he ſpake of himſelf, as he was the Son of God, (not as he was not) <hi>viz.</hi> as he was God and Man (viſible), and not of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture only, which was inviſible, and muſt have been an unſeen Son, which could not be underſtood.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="6" facs="tcp:175804:6"/> 2. Chriſt explains what Son it was he ſpake of, <hi>verſ.</hi> 36. <hi>Say ye of him whom the Father hath ſanctified, and ſent into the World, thou blaſphemeſt, becauſe I ſaid, I am the Son of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now let the Underſtanding judge, whether it was the Divine Nature only, that the Father ſanctified, and ſent into the World. 1. Whether on that account he had need to be ſanctified, and ſent into the world? 2. Whether That was ſanctified and ſent into the world, as the Son of God, diſtinct from the Humane Nature? 3. Whether we are not to underſtand, by the Fathers ſanctifying and ſending, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Father's ſetting apart, and ſending his Son into the world to be the Saviour thereof, according to 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 14? If ſo, it muſt be, as he was ſanctified and ſent to be a Saviour, (and not as he was not) which was as God and Man, not in the Divine Nature only, that is contrary to the Scripture, and Faith of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
                        <p>So then fourthly, Whether to underſtand Chriſt to be the Son of God in the Divine Nature only, leaving out the Humane, be not the ready way to un-Son and un-Chriſt the true Chriſt and Son of God, as held forth in the true light and ſence of Scripture, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 22, 23. and 4. 2, 3, 9?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the Jews did not thus underſtand him is likewiſe clear, <hi>verſ.</hi> 33. <hi>Thou being a Man makeſt thy ſelf God;</hi> they underſtood that he ſpake of himſelf as Man, and not of his Divinity only. And this he made good, and not a word that they miſ-apprehended him.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>John</hi> 5. 17, 18. is to be underſtood as this, as the Text and Context doth explain, as any judicious Perſon may eaſily underſtand, Read from <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. to 27. the ſame who is the Son of God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. is the Son of Man, <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. and (I think) that is not the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature only. See <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. <hi>The word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth.</hi> This I have before clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was the word made fleſh, which was <hi>the only begotten of the Father.</hi> Whoſe glory they ſaw with their eyes, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1, 2. Which was not the Divine Nature only, that was never ſeen of any, otherwiſe than as perſonated in the Son of God, and in the Son of God, was converſive with men. So 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 9. is as plain as the Sun when it ſhines, that it intends Chriſt the Son of God in both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for it is the ſame Son, that <hi>God ſent into the world to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our ſins.</hi> And I think the Divine Nature only, was not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:175804:6"/> the Propitiatory, or Peace-making Sacrifice for our ſins, And for <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. it is a Queſtion (and I think) too hard for any man (undoubtedly to reſolve; whether that Scripture intends the Son of God, though it's generally ſo underſtood. 1. Becauſe there is no mention of the Son, under that Name and Title. 2. Becauſe the Wiſdom here ſpoken of, is in the Feminine Gender, Her, and She, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. 2. and <hi>Ch.</hi> 9. 1, 2. which is not proper to the Son of God, nor is he ſo deſcribed in the Scripture; but in the Maſculine Gender, He and Him; therefore it may intend the infinit Wiſdom of God, exerciſed in and about the works of Creation, rejoycing in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight thereof: or if it intend the perſon of the Son of God, it muſt be as God and man, as he came forth in time, for ſo is he called <hi>The Wiſdom and Power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 24. And indeed the myſtery and wiſdom of God, is in the Perſon of his Son; and his works that have been, and are to be effected, have been, and ſhall be all done in and by him; in and by him is the <hi>manifold wiſdom</hi> and power of God made manifeſt.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Text may be ſo underſtood, for the word Tranſlated, <hi>brought-forth,</hi> is in the Hebrew <hi>formed, Was I formed.</hi> Elſe he could not be ſet <hi>up from everlaſting;</hi> and wiſdom ſeems to ſpeak as perſonated in the Son of God, <hi>viz, Rejoycing in the habitable parts of his Earth;</hi> not of my Earth, which had been proper, if it had been the Divine Nature only; but the Son always exalts the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 19.

                        <p>Whether to affirm <hi>that Chriſt is the Son of God only in the Divine Nature, in oppoſition to the Human Nature, and</hi> Davids <hi>Son only in the Human Nature,</hi> do not unavoidably make two Sons in that one Perſon; one, only the Son of God; the other, only the Son of <hi>David?</hi> and whether this do not tend truly to deny the true Chriſt the Son of God? the Scripture letting us to know that there is but <hi>one Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> one Son of God and man, one Saviour of the world in one Perſon.</p>
                        <p>Further, the Scripture lets us to know that Chriſt was conſidered as the Son of man, before he came in fleſh; and then certainly, he that was ſo conſidered, as with the Father, muſt be the Son of God, and that he was ſo conſidered as the Son of man, as with the Father, before he came in fleſh; to prove this, we have a cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 13. &amp; 6. 33, 35, 38, 41, 42, 51, 62. and 16. 27. 30. and 17. 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 47. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 9. 10.

                        <p n="3">3. <hi>That he was the Word as he was God-Man, and Man-God.</hi> That which I ſaid, &amp; do ſtill ſay, is, <hi>That the ſame Word and Son of God, God-Man, was made Fleſh;</hi> that is, <hi>made in and of a Woman, born God and Man, him by whom the world was made, and nothing was made without him,</hi> pag. 33. and this I ſtill ſay, becauſe the Scripture ſaith it, The ſame <hi>Word was made Fleſh, and dwelt among us, and they ſaw his glory,</hi> &amp;c. which I explained before, with 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1, 2. it was the ſame Word by which the world was made, that was <hi>made Fleſh, and they ſaw his glory.</hi> It was by him (conſidered as Chriſt Jeſus, the

                        <p>And probably this myſterious Truth is ſo abundantly ſtated in the word of truth, becauſe the Lord knew with what difficulty men would come to underſtand and believe, that Chriſt the Son of God <hi>is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever.</hi> Though it be a myſtery too hard for us to underſtand how it is, yet not too hard for God; that his Son ſhould be the ſame from Eternity, and yet in time to be <hi>made of the Seed of</hi> David, <hi>according to the Fleſh, declared to be the Son of God by his Reſurrection from the Dead.</hi> This is a myſtery, that men &amp; Angels may wonder at, and believe it, though we cannot underſtand the manner how it is; and it concerns us, Not to contradict it, becauſe we underſtand it not; nor too curiouſly to pry into it, but believe it, becauſe God hath ſaid it; remembring that Chriſt hath a hidden Name that no man knoweth but Himſelf and Father, nor probably ever ſhall, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 27. And herein lyeth the wonderful myſtery of the love of God to men, to have one to be his own proper Son, in his own Nature, and in our Nature, united, that we by Faith might be the Sons of God in him.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>That as God-Man he was a Creature,</hi> pag. 31. That which I there ſaid, is, <hi>That he was conſidered as in his both Natures from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as the Son of</hi> God, Col. 1. 15. <hi>Who is the Image of the inviſible</hi> God, <hi>the firſt-born of every Creature; that, in this verſe, and the verſes before, he is ſpoken of as God-Man, for ſo he was a Creature, a Son, a wonderful one.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Againſt this it is Objected, 1. <hi>That it is not ſaid that he is the firſt Created, but the firſt born.</hi> 2. <hi>That it is not ſaid, he is the firſt born of every Creature, as being one of them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. I do not ſay he was the firſt Created, but the firſt Born in God of every Creature, as he is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 29. to be <hi>the firſt born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many Brethren.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. That he is ſpoken of as the firſt-born of every Creature, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of them, is moſt clear and manifeſt, though he was laſt in manifeſtation, yet was firſt in order of nature and deſign; He that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:175804:8"/> is Lord of all, muſt be before all; and this is it, is intended in this place, as the ſcope and ſence of the words doth demonſtrate, that he was the firſt born of every Creature, as being one of them, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more glorious than all of them. That this is it is intended, appears not only in that it ſpeaks of him, the ſame, <hi>in whom we have Redemption by his Blood,</hi> v. 14. <hi>As having made peace by the blood of his Croſs,</hi> v. 20. which was as Man, and ſo a Creature. But 2. From the ſame word being compared with <hi>v.</hi> 18. where he is ſaid to be <hi>the firſt born of the Dead;</hi> its the ſame word as <hi>v.</hi> 15. The firſt born of every Creature, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

It appears from the reaſon of his being the firſt born of every Creature; that is, <hi>For by him were all things cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 16. Therefore he muſt be the firſt born, he muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; and how he was before all things, even as he came forth in time, hath been already ſufficiently cleared. 4. It will further appear, compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. where he is ſaid <hi>to be the firſt-born among many Brethren,</hi> which certainly muſt be as one of them, or elſe there is nothing in the words: So in this, muſt we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him to be the firſt born of every Creature, as being one of them, or there is nothing in the words; but it's plain, that as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. preſents Chriſt in Perſon, as at the bottom of Election, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and Salvation, ſo this preſents him as at the bottom of the Creation.</p>
                        <p>And that he was a Creature and the Creator too, is moſt evident, God and Man in one Perſon; for if he was a man, then he was a Creature, elſe he could not have dyed; if he was not a Creature, then he was no man, ſo that you may ſee whither ſuch Un-ſcriptural Notions will lead; but to be the Creator &amp; a Creature in one Perſon, is no more but the ſame, as, God &amp; Man in one Perſon. The ſum of all, is this, That he was the firſt that was begotten, or born in the Eternal Will and Boſom of the Father, and that as he came forth in time, God and man, the Creator and a Creature, in one Perſon, him by whom all was made.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>That this Creature God-Man made all things;</hi> and who durſt to deny this, the Scripture being ſo abundantly full in this matter, that I need ſay nothing further to confirm it, the denial here of giving the Scripture the Lye, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 15, 16. and Blaſphemy againſt the Son of God.</p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:175804:8"/>
                        <p> But the doubt is, that I allow Chriſt no more <hi>than to be a</hi> medium, <hi>or inſtrument in this matter:</hi> To this I ſay, that he was both a <hi>medium</hi> or inſtrument, and efficient cauſe and worker therein; as he is the <hi>medium</hi> in the work of Redemption, a Mediator between God and man, yet he that hath wrought forth our Redemption; So, its the ſame in all his works, <hi>John</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Hitherto the Father worketh, and I work.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. <hi>That this word God-Man was made Fleſh.</hi> This I have (in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) already often anſwered, and from Scripture proved, that he that was the Word was made Fleſh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14. But here (it ſeems) lyeth the block in the way, <hi>Then he that was a Man was made a Man.</hi> The reſolve is clear from Scripture, he that was God and man in Gods Eye, was made ſo in our eye, when made, or manifeſted in Fleſh, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6, 7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. <hi>That he is the Son of man in both Natures.</hi> I do not ſay that he had the nature of God from Man, or from the Woman, nor that the nature of man was the Nature of God, or that there was a confuſion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but the contrary; but that the Son of God <hi>was born of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> Gal. 4. 4. and ſo was truly the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſo the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of <hi>David,</hi> Luk. 1. 35. <hi>He that ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Son of God;</hi> and this Son of God was the Son of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> the Son of Man, the Son of <hi>David,</hi> v. 32, 33. <hi>John</hi> 5. 22.—27. The ſame that is the Son of God, is the Son of Man; and the ſame that is the Son of Man, is the Son of God; ſo not two, but one Son; therefore let not man preſume to make two, or to diſ-unite what God hath united. This great truth further appears from the promiſe of breaking the Serpent's head, to the Seed of the Woman, and the bleſſing to the Nations in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed; which Seed muſt be whole Chriſt, God and Man, elſe (as Man only) he could neither break the Serpents head, nor make the Nations bleſſed; but whole Chriſt, the Son of God, is in Gods account, and ſo in Scripture, called the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THere having been various and differing apprehenſions among men about this great Truth of the Goſpel, by reaſon of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that hath in part befaln us all; under the ſence of which, we have cauſe to be humbled: I ſhall, according to what I have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from Scripture-light, briefly give forth; as followeth,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That Chriſt died for the World, that is, the Univerſe, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Earth, and all things therein, the whole ſix days Creation, that ſell with man for the ſin of man, as a Curſe to man for his ſin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17, 18, 19. and the Whole ſhall be reſtored again out of that Eſtate, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 20. 21. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 5. And this Renovation and New-life to the world, muſt be effected by Jeſus Chriſt, Crucified and raiſed again from the dead; its founded here, He died and revived that the world might live, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 33. <hi>The Bread of God is He, which cometh down from Heaven, and giveth life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World;</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 51. <hi>The Bread that I will give, is my Fleſh which I will give for the life of the World,</hi> Joh. 14. 4. This is for the Salvation and Life of the World out of the faln ſtate; by the Death, Reſurrection and Life of Chriſt, it ſhall all be accompliſhed in his time; that, as the firſt death and loſs of the world, came in by the diſobedience of the Firſt man, ſo the Reſtauration muſt be effected by the <hi>Second Man, who is the Lord from Heaven,</hi> Rom. 5. 18, 19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 21, 22, 47. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 20, 21.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And more eſpecially, in order to the accompliſhment of this great and univerſal deſign of God, he died for all Man-kind (which is included in the firſt); and in this ſence he died for the ſins of the whole world, and that becauſe, Sin it was, that brought in Death,

                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:175804:12"/> 1. The Church of the old Covenant, the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Proſelyted Gentiles, were the Elected and choſen of God to be his Church; and he made it their duty and priviledge to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and keep that Covenant, and to worſhip him in that Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relation; and this was his more general Election and choice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 6. to 16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 37. and 7. 6. and 10. 15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 10, 11, 13. and 3, 1, 2.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And among thoſe there was a ſpecial Election and choice of thoſe who walked uprightly with God in that Covenant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 5, 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 3. and 34. 11.—15. and 37. 18, 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 27. and 11. 4.</p>
                     <p>There is likewiſe a general Election in the Goſpel, &amp; that is, all that do believe and obey the Goſpel, they are the Elect Church of the Goſpel, and are reputed the New-Covenant-People and Church of Chriſt; and its their great concernment to be ſincere to God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and ſo to perſevere in the Faith and Obedience of the Goſpel, as to obtain the end, and of whom we are bound to hope that it will be ſo, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6, 7. Yet out of this Elect Church of Chriſt, its poſſible that many may fail of the grace of God, and ſo come ſhort of the glory of the Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 15. The Church thus conſidered, as the Elect Church of God, viſible in the Goſpel, we may (and muſt) underſtand in theſe and the like Scriptures, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28 19, 20. which is the Commiſſion of Chriſt for ſtating and conſtituting the Goſpel-Church and worſhip of God therein, with the promiſe of Chriſts preſence with them in their walking according thereunto; and to whom is the Promiſe of Salvation in their conſtancy in the Faith and Obedience of the Goſpel, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. and it will be their great damage who come into the Church, and afterwards fail of the grace of God, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20, 21. And the Church and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are thus conſidered as is apparent in the method of all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, which includes all the Believers and Members as the called Ones of God, and yet ſuppoſeth a poſſibility of departing from the Lord, and the Church is thus conſidered, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21, 22, 23. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Heb</hi> 3. 6. And that all that believe and obey the Goſpel, are the New-Covenant Church of Chriſt, is ſo common and plain in the Scripture, as that (I ſuppoſe) it's ſcarcely doubted of any, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2, 3. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 1, 4, 5, 6, 7. 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2. 5. to 10.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is a ſecond and ſpecial Election in the New-Covenant, and this we are likewiſe to underſtand to be two fold.</p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:175804:13"/>
                     <p> The 1. are ſuch, or ſome who were Elected and choſen of God in his Son before the World was, to the obtaining of the ſpecial grace and glory of the New-Covenant in the Reſtauration; and this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection was from the freeneſs of grace in God, without any reſpect to fore-ſeen Faith and Obedience, as the meritorious or deſerving cauſe thereof, though this Election was to believe and obey the Goſpel, and perſevere therein unto the end, as the way to obtain the glory; and this Election we are to underſtand is intended in theſe and the like Scriptures, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29, 30. and we may rationally conceive (and that groundedly from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) ſomething of the reaſon of this Choiſe or Election, <hi>viz.</hi> That the undertaking of Chriſt in the Reſtauration, might be aſſured, not to be in vain on the moſt ſpecial account; ſome were given to him by the Father, as a ſure and certain reward of his gracious and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous undertaking, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 39. and 10. 15, 16. And thus the Prophet, perſonating Chriſt ſeems to reaſon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 4, 5, 6. and God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers that his Labour ſhould not be in vain, and declares the work that was before him, and ſhould be accompliſhed by him, in which, this of ſpecial grace and Election is included, the ſpecial Salvation both of Jews and Gentiles being aſſured there.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſort of ſpecial Election in the Goſpel is, All that do believe and obey the Goſpel in Truth, perſevering therein to the end, are Elected to be ſaved; and this Election is the ſame in ſubſtance as the firſt Election to the Church-ſtate: only in this it differs; the firſt includes all that believe and obey the Goſpel; this includes all that are ſincere, and perſevere to the end: and this likewiſe includes all the ſpecial Elect, even all that believe and obey the Goſpel to the end; and the reaſon is, becauſe all muſt obtain the Salvation of the Goſpel in the ſame way, <hi>viz.</hi> of Faith, Obedience, and Perſeverance, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 22. Of the Election under this conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> of all that do believe and obey the Goſpel to the end, its declared in theſe and the like Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 40. &amp; 3. 16. &amp; 8. 31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21. 23. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 14.</p>
                     <p>And this ſecond Election it is the Apoſtle ſeems moſt to adhere unto, both for himſelf and others, becauſe the firſt is a hidden myſtery, no man knows it: (In the firſt) it is God only <hi>that knows who are his.</hi> We know our Election by believing and obeying the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. The firſt we ought to believe, but its the ſecond that we muſt ſtand or fall by; therefore I ſaid, the Apoſtle ſeems rather to adhere to this both for himſelf and others, as that wherein our aſſurance conſiſts:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:175804:13"/> 1. For himſelf, he builds not his aſſurance on ſpecial Election, but on conſtancy in the Faith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 26, 27. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7, 8. 2. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects all others the ſame way, <hi>viz.</hi> To look to their conſtancy in the Faith to the end, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7. 10. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21.—23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 6. To prove that more may be ſaved than the firſt and ſpecial Elect and gift to Chriſt, I ſhall demonſtrate from theſe following grounds.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We may not ſo underſtand particular and ſpecial Election, as to derogate from the univerſal grace and love of God to all men; nor from the truth of the law of grace, which calleth upon all, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth all, and promiſeth life to all that do believe and obey the Goſpel; which if we ſhould ſo underſtand Election in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, as to ſhut out all beſides, it would tend to contradict the Goſpel in the general tenders of grace to all, and ſo contradict a great part of the glorious and bleſſed Goſpel of grace to men, and be a great ſtumbling-block in the hopeful way of Salvation, and a great diſcouragement to poor Sinners in their believing and obeying the Goſpel; therefore (I ſay) we may not ſo underſtand the Decrees of God which are ſecret, as to make-null the plain declared will of God in the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 3, 4. but we are to Preach the Goſpel, and to aſſure Sinners, that if they believe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and obey the Lord therein they ſhall be ſaved, perſevering therein to the end; this is the Goſpel law of grace, and Will of the Lord, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 22.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Lord himſelf makes this diſtinction, with ſuitable promiſes alike to both, <hi>i. e.</hi> He alloweth a latitude beyond the firſt and ſpecial Election or gift to his Son, with promiſe of life on the univerſal account of grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 37. There is firſt a deſcription of the firſt and ſpecial gift; <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me.</hi> 2. An encouragement to all comers; <hi>And him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out: Him,</hi> that is, every one that cometh; for it cannot rightly be ſuppoſed, that him that cometh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a promiſe to the firſt gift, for they ſhall come, <hi>i. e.</hi> believe and obey the Goſpel, and there is no doubt of their being caſt out that are given, and ſhall come: But to prevent a doubt that might ariſe from the knowledge of the firſt gift, the ſecond promiſe followeth to aſſure us, that the ſpecial gift no whit derogates from the freedom of univerſal grace; and <hi>v.</hi> 39. 40. more fully confirms the ſame truth, <hi>v.</hi> 39. Chriſt ſtates the firſt gift, [&amp; they ſhall come]; <hi>This is the Fathers will which hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me I ſhould loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt day;</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 40. declareth
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:175804:14"/> the univerſal grace and encouragement to all, to believe and obey the Goſpel; <hi>And this is the will of him that ſent me, that every one that ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life,</hi> &amp;c. And this agreeth fully with the general Promiſes of the Goſpeli ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſtated in the Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1, 2, 3, 6, 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Sutable to this, are we to underſtand the Book of Life, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Scriptures: 1. Of Gods fore-knowledge and Election to the ſpecial and eſpouſed relation to his Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 8. and 17. 8. and 21. 27.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It intends the Goſpel Book of Life, in which is the Law of Life, and the Promiſes of Life to all Believers; it worketh Life, and propoundeth and promiſeth Life on the terms thereof: this is the viſible Book of Life, the revealed will of God about the matters of Life, and properly belongs to us as the revealed will of God; and we are not to ſuppoſe any thing in the hidden Book of Life, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that which is revealed; and this Book of Life we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand to be intended in theſe Scriptures, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 5. and 20, 12, 15. and 22. 19. All which muſt be underſtood to be the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book of Life, in which all Believers are written, and not the firſt Book of Life, for out of that none ſhall be blotted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29, 36. But out of the ſecond Book of Life, many may be blotted, and loſe their part therein, through their own default, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 19. And that it muſt be this Book that promiſeth Life on the terms thereof, further appears; becauſe among the reſt of the Books, <hi>the Book of Life was opened, and they were judged according to the things written in the Books,</hi> i. e. how they had lived ſutable to the Laws thereof; the Book of Election in the firſt ſenſe will be no rule of judging by at that day; but the Book of the Goſpel, and the Laws thereof, ſhall be the rule of judging by, to thoſe that have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 48. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It appears that ſpecial Election is no ground to diſcourage any from believing and obeying the Goſpel, that they may be ſaved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we find not in Scripture, that any were diſcouraged on this ground among the many thouſands that believed, both of Jews and Gentiles; yea, even of thoſe that <hi>Crucified the Lord of Life;</hi> yet they ſtumbled not at this ſtumbling ſtone, but gladly received the word of Salvation, which diſcovers that they underſtood not Election to lie as any block in the hopeful way thereof.</p>

                        <p>Touching the Power and Will of Man.</p>
                        <p>Whether we may ſuppoſe it to be of capacity to believe and obey the the Goſpel, ſo as to live thereby.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THat there is a capacity in men (by the help of the means and miniſteries of God, under which they live) to underſtand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and obey the Lord therein, ſuitable to the means and miniſtry, will appear to be unqueſtionable; though without, and at a diſtance from all means and miniſtry from without, there is no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity either of will or power in any man; but ſuitable to the means and miniſtry, there muſt be, and is a capacity both of power and will in all men; not but that the capacity both of power and will is of God, but that of him there is ſuch a capacity in all men, that are men, (and not debilitated of the ordinary capacities of men) appeareth from theſe five following grounds.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In that God hath ſtated it to be the bounden duty of all men (ſuitable to the means and miniſtry they are, or have, been under) to believe and obey him. That this is true, fully appears from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the Gentiles, who had no other means or miniſtry but the works of God, which was the general miniſtry of God to the world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19, 20. God ſo far teaching thereby, as to leave the world <hi>without excuſe,</hi> which clearly imports that God expected (as duty) a return from them ſuitable to the miniſtry they were under, which we may not imagine, if they had no capacity to perform it.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:175804:15"/> 2. The Jews, under the miniſtration of the Law, which was a higher and additional miniſtry, and ſuitably, it was their duty to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and obey the Lord therein, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 9. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. throughout, with multitude of Scriptures of like import.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Under the miniſtration of the glorious Goſpel, he hath made it the duty of all men that come under the hearing thereof, to believe and obey him therein, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 47. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 30. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 3, 4. All which, proves a capacity in men to anſwer his will, or we muſt reflect on God; ſuppoſing that he requireth of men that which by his helps they can in no caſe perform, and ſo juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſaying of the evil Servant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 24.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It appears, in that he blames thoſe under all his miniſtrations, that did not, nor do not, ſuitably believe and obey him therein.</p>
                     <p>As 1. The Gentiles under the miniſtry of the Creation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. to 25.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p n="3">3. It appears in that God hath threatned and executed, and doth threaten, and will execute Judgment upon all that have, do, or ſhall diſobey him in his ſeveral miniſtrations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Gentiles that lived (or do live) only under the miniſtry of the Creation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 24. 26, 27. And will execute future Judgment upon them that live not to him therein, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Jews for ſinning againſt him under the miniſtry of the Law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 14. to 43. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 15. to the end; all which was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for their diſobedience againſt God: See Lamentations of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi> with multitudes of other Scriptures that do confirm the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Under the Goſpel great wrath is threatned, and muſt be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon all under the Miniſtry thereof that do not believe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it; as alſo great promiſes are made to all that do believe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the ſame, <hi>Mark</hi> 15. 15, 16. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
                     <p>All which ſeriouſly conſidered, muſt needs tend to prove a capacity in man (with the helps of thoſe Miniſteries) to believe and obey the Lord therein, or elſe we cannot have right, honourable, and God-like
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:175804:16"/> thoughts of him, to require, blame, pitty, promiſe, threaten, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute terrible Judgment on a people that in no caſe was able to help it; I know what it would render any man ſo to do in all rational mens underſtandings. Let us dread the having ſo diſhonourable thoughts of God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It muſt be ſo, becauſe the contrary leaves the Condemnation of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at God's dore, which far be it from any ſober ſpirit to imagine: for God to bring forth a glorious Miniſtration of Grace and Life to the World, &amp; tender it to Sinners on ſuch terms, as is impoſſible for them to perform, with the helps he affords, &amp; to damn them for non-perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof, neceſſarily leaves a neceſſity of periſhing without hope or help: So that if this were true, that men could not believe and obey the Goſpel, where it comes ſimply from their debility and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, and the debility of the means afforded them for help there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, It could not be their ſin; for its no mans ſin not to do what he cannot do, but what he can and might do, had he a will to do it. The contrary ſuppoſeth that God hath laid a neceſſity upon the World, to die the ſecond death, whereas by ſin men deſtroy themſelves.</p>
                     <p>This I am bold to affirm, as ſuitable to the holy Name of God, that he will damn no man for that which in no caſe he could not help, but what-ever hath befaln man, or doth befall him, that he could not, nor in any caſe cannot help, it is his Affliction, but not his Sin, and ſuch things ſhall never occaſion the ſecond death. Its true, the firſt death is come on all men by <hi>Adams</hi> Tranſgreſſion, they having the ſame original nature of ſin and death, its come into all men as a Judgment for the firſt tranſgreſſion, but not as a ſin to the ſecond death.</p>
                     <p>To inſtance in ſome particular caſes, that what man cannot help, is not his ſin, but his affliction. Its generally granted that its not the ſin, but affliction of thoſe born naturally Ideots, or through natural diſtempers loſe their ſenſes, becauſe they cannot help it: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Sickneſs in it ſelf is an affliction, not a ſin. A man that hath a bad memory, he bewailes it, and endeavours its help; it is not his ſin, but his affliction. Damnation is the judgment of Goſpel-unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and diſobedience; yet thoſe that never heard the Goſpel, cannot be under this Judgment, becauſe its impoſſible (without a miracle) that they ſhould believe the Goſpel; its (in ſome ſenſe) their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and judgment that they have it not, but not their ſin, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it not, becauſe they cannot, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14.</p>
                     <p>All men are born into the world with ſinful Natures, commonly called original ſin, becauſe it is derived originally from our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:175804:16"/> Now this defilement of our Natures, though ſinful, no man can help; therefore it is not their ſin, but their affliction, and cauſe we have to bewail it, as our affliction, but not as our ſin; ſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. It is conſenting to it which is the ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15, 16. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 14, 15. When perſons conſent to covetous and wordly Luſts, to proud, envious, and diſobedient Luſts, this is the ſin that will uſher in the ſecond death; original guilt, and ſtain only brings under the firſt death, but not the ſecond, as diſtinct from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, (from which, God hath ordained a bleſſed remedy, if men were willing to improve the ſame.) This truth acquits not only Idiots, but all Infants (ſo dying) from the ſecond death; whoſe debility is ſuch, as they cannot help, relative to the defilement of their Natures, and incapacity to believe the Goſpel; and therefore God hath given no Law unto them, and <hi>where is no Law, is no tranſgreſſion;</hi> all which ſerves to confirm the matter in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> The ability that is in men to believe, ſuitable to the means and Miniſtry, without which they ſhould not die the ſecond death, which muſt be for wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and not for weakneſs; and likewiſe that the contrary leaves the Condemnation of the World at God's dore.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It appears, in that the true and righteous God expoſtulates the matter with ſinful men, to convince both them and us, that his ways are equal and juſt, and ſinful mans ways<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are unjuſt and unequal, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 25, 29, 30. and 23. 17. to 20. which could not be, if man had no power at all to eſchew the evil which he forbiddeth, or do the good which he requireth; neither the one, nor other could be ſin in man, had he no power thereunto; nor could it be juſt and equal in God to puniſh man for not doing that which he could not. In this, lyeth the difference between Men and Beaſts: they have no capacity to underſtand and obey; therefore God hath given no Law unto them; and hence it is that they do not, cannot ſin; and they who deny any power in man to will, and to do the will of God, according to his Miniſtries; they render men to be but as Beaſts; and God, as giving Laws to Brutes, which would not only be diſhonourable, but unequal; therefore let us be more prudent than to have ſo diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable thoughts of God, who will let all men know in the end that in his Miniſtries he had to do with men capable to underſtand him, and ſuitably will he judge them in Righteouſneſs, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 31.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. God doth not require under any of his Miniſtrations, the exerciſe of the power that is loſt, but the power that is yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining; here lyeth the great miſtake in this matter: It's true, We are to ſuppoſe that <hi>Adam</hi> had a power in his perfect and ſinleſs E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to have yielded perfect obedience to his Maker, and that he loſt, and that is not now required. But ſince the Fall, that which God requires, is ſincere obedience under all his Miniſtries; he knew there could be no perfect obedience by reaſon of debility, through corruption of nature, but he knew that man might yield ſincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in Faith and Love, and in that hath promiſed both aſſiſtance and acceptance in his Son; (ſee this further cleared in the next Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> He requireth ſincere obedience) ſo that this objection falls and comes to nothing; for <hi>he accepteth us according to what we have, and not according to what we have not;</hi> and he will judge men at the laſt day, not for, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>or by) their loſt power in <hi>Adam,</hi> but for their own wilful wickedneſs, and not improving the power they have.</p>

Therefore let us not retain that which tends to reflect ſo much on the Holy and Infinite, Wiſe and Righteous, God.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Nor are we to underſtand men to be as dead (that is, as unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to believe and obey the Goſpel) as the merely ſenſitive, irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and brutiſh Creatures.

                        <p n="1">1. That all men by ſin, are in a ſtate of death; and that, natural, ſpiritual, and, without help, eternal.</p>

No man Can believe and obey the Goſpel that never heard it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. This being the way of God's drawing and working ſouls to himſelf, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 18. This is his way of drawing, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 4. and without this drawing, no man can come, <hi>Joh.</hi> 30. 31. And its no more than what I ſay, that there is a capacity in man, with the helps that God affords, to believe and obey the Goſpel, and without it there is no capacity.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. No man can come to Chriſt that will not come; and where the Goſpel is publiſhed, there is no Cannot, without a Will-not, Tha's the Cannot that keeps people at a diſtance from Chriſt and Life; it ariſeth from the averſeneſs of their Wills; they will not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot find in their hearts to accept Chriſt and Life on the Goſpel-terms, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 40. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 16. This wilful Cannot ariſeth, 1. From the habit and cuſtom in ſin: perſons being habitually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſin, will not, cannot part with it; will not Repent and turn to the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 23. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots? then may ye do good that are accuſtomed to do evil.</hi> Cuſtom in ſin, makes reſolute and wilful therein, to the perdition and deſtruction of multitudes; this is the Cannot which keeps ſouls at a diſtance from God under all his Miniſteries.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. as an effect hereof, Perſons cannot leave their ſins and turn to the Lord, becauſe they love them, and will keep them. And whiles its thus, they cannot imbrace Chriſt on the Goſpel-terms; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find in their hearts to leave all for Chriſt; its with ſuch in this matter, as it was with thoſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 25. After all the Lord's calls and invitations to return, they ſaid, <hi>There is no hope, no, for I have loved ſtrangers, and after them will I goe.</hi> While the Will follows the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:175804:18"/> affections &amp; luſts, there Can be no returning to the Lord; while its thus, they are like thoſe, <hi>Job</hi> 21. 14. <hi>They ſay unto God, Depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledg of thy ways;</hi> and while its thus, its no marvel they cannot come to Chriſt, becauſe their wills are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; they will not come, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 19, 20.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Devil taketh his advantage to hinder the work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and a Soul turning to the Lord; In blinding the mind, and hardening the heart, thereby aggravating the difficulties, that corrupt Nature it ſelf is ready to ſuggeſt, <hi>viz.</hi> forſaking Sin, the beloved Luſts, loving and cleaving to Holineſs, ſtrictneſs of Life, reproach for Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which, maintains a Will-not, and ſo a Cannot, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. But there is no cannot ariſing alone from mans debility, <hi>i. e.</hi> want of reaſon and underſtanding to refuſe the Evil, and to chooſe the Good, and power to will and affect the Good, but as it is captivated by the brutiſh ſenſual part: the underſtanding and reaſon, yielding thereunto, rather than to the Goſpel-light, wilfully refuſes the proffers of Grace and Life on the Goſpel-terms thereof, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 40.</p>

                        <p>If we may ſuppoſe the Miniſtry to go without the Spirit working therein, then we may ſuppoſe a poſſibility in reſpect of power; elſe men could not be condemned for not believing, if they had no power to believe, in as much as the ſecond death comes in for not believing; and if men have no power to believe and obey unto Life, it leaves the diſobedient excuſable, as objects of Pitty rather than of Wrath.</p>
                        <p>Therefore 2. There being a debility in Man by the Fall, and the prevalency of corrupt Nature, and averſeneſs of the will; God adds a further help to his Miniſtries; that is, his Spirit working in and with his Miniſtries. We have ground from Scripture to believe, that as all mercy hath been (in ſome true ſence) Goſpel-mercy ſince the Fall, ſo God hath wrought by his Spirit in all his Miniſtries ſince the Fall. 1. In the Miniſtry of the Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 20. 23. 2. Under the Law, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 20 <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 50. although the Goſpel is the higheſt and moſt ſpiritual Miniſtry, being the moſt open and full in order to glory. It's called <hi>the Miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its adminiſtred immediately by and from Jeſus Chriſt the Lord thereof, and is therefore more attended with the power of the Spirit; for the honour and glory of the Lord thereof, and for the Eſpouſing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:175804:19"/> of ſouls to Himſelf, ſo that the Goſpel adminiſters a ſufficiency of ſupply to help, over all difficulties.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. God requires not perfection in the Faith and Obedience of the Goſpel (as before I ſaid) but Sincerity: He, knowing the weakneſs of man, and the many impediments in the way, did, in all, require the ſincerity of faith and obedience in which they ſhould be accepted: yea, even under the Law, (though the Law required perfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>He that failed in one point, was guilty of all:</hi> yet) there was ſo much annexed to it, as clearly implied, that its perfection conſiſted in Univerſality and Sincerity, rather than in Perfection without any Imperfection or Failing, elſe, What means <hi>the ſhewing mercy to thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, of them that love him and keep his Commandements,</hi> Exod. 20. 6. that is, in ſincerity, not in perfection, for then they had needed no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, for mercy was extended to them in the pardon of ſin, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7. which was a confirmation of the promiſe before-mentioned. And, that his people did ſo underſtand, that it was ſincerity of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which God required, is evident, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 21. and 26. 1. and 51. 6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 3. or elſe there could have been no acceptance on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which was promiſed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 21, 22. And ſo it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the Goſpel, as appears, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1. with <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 24.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. If God did not work at all by his Spirit, but only give the Goſpel, which hath in it ſelf a natural tendency to draw Sinners to Chriſt; if, according to their capacities, they believe and obey it, they ſhould undoubtedly be ſaved; and if not, it will leave them without excuſe, <hi>becauſe they believed not in the name of the Son of God,</hi> Joh. 3. 18. Yet ſo it is, that, by reaſon of the Corruption of Nature, cuſtom in ſin, and the averſeneſs of the will, it comes to paſs, that rarely, if at all, any do ſavingly believe and obey the Goſpel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the effectual working of the holy Spirit therein, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 19. <hi>When any one heareth the Word, and underſtandeth</hi> (or conſidereth) <hi>it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was ſown in the heart,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Spirit worketh in the Goſpel, To convince of ſin, and the need and worth of a Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 8. to 11. And this may be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in many, that may come ſhort of an effectual cloſing in, with Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel; who by reaſon of the love of Sin, Self, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:175804:19"/> the World, fear of Tribulation for the ſake of Chriſt, looſe their Convictions, and turn away from the Truth to their own deſtruction, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 20, 21, 22. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20, 21, 22.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Spirit by the word of the Goſpel, works a willing mind to leave all for Chriſt, to turn to, and to accept him as Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and to cleave to him in the Faith, Love, and Obedience of the Goſpel; and this he effects in all Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>believers alike, which are the Elect in the three-fold ſence before minded; and might all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, were they ſincere and conſtant to the end, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 3. Yet of theſe, its poſſible that ſome may miſcarry and come ſhort of the glory of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19, 20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 12, 13, 14.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. He will preſerve all (who look to him, and live upon him) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Heavenly glory, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 30, 31. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And he will in the ſame way certainly preſerve all the ſpecial Elect and choſen-ones, to the glory to come, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 39, 40.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. And after believing and obeying the Goſpel, God uſually giveth a greater meaſure of his Spirit to his people in the gifts and graces thereof, as a ſealing evidence of their relation to him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. &amp; 5. 22, 23. and to impower them more abundantly to do and ſuffer what he calls them to, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 16. and 6. 10. and this our Lord would have his people to pray for, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 13. it being the promiſe of the New Covenant, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38, 39. From whence we may conclude, that after believing, Chriſtians are (or might be) in a better capacity to live to God, than before; and therefore the Condemnation of ſuch as do not improve this their mercy will be the greater, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 29, 30. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And as for the manner of the Spirit's working in the work of Goſpel-converſion; 1. It's ſecret, &amp; inviſible, and therefore unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, as to us, and is better underſtood by its effects, than in the manner of working; ſo that we underſtand it when he hath by the Goſpel inlightened, convinced, and converted us to the Lord, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. 23, 24 and 4. 6.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In this great Work he always worketh in the Word of the Goſpel by that means and miniſtry, and not without it: the Word and Spirit may not be ſeparated, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 5. and 17. 20. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The manner of the Spirit's working is not contrary, but ſuitable to our reaſon and capacities as men; it deſtroys not our reaſon and

                        <p n="1">1. Negatively: This Scripture doth not ſuppoſe that there is no power to Will or Run, but rather that willing and running will not do it. Nor 2. May we underſtand that it deſigns to take-off from all willing and running, in order to the obtaining of Goſpel-Life: for, that is contrary to the whole ſcope of the Goſpel, which commandeth all to Believe, Repent, &amp; Obey the Lord therein; and the promiſes of Life are only to ſuch, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 15, 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9.

                        <p>Theſe I take as true and unerring Rules in the underſtanding of Scripture: 1. Not to underſtand any dark Scripture, contrary to the plain revealed Will of God in his Goſpel-Law of Grace; this muſt needs be corrupt and dangerous. 2. Not to underſtand any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo, as to contradict others, eſpecially ſo as to contradict the Volum of the Book of God, and Law of Grace, as either of theſe

                        <p n="2">2. Therefore, 2dly. Affirmatively, we muſt neceſſarily underſtand that it tends to keep us, in our Willing and Running, to the right rule and right end in running; and therefore we may underſtand either, 1. That it is not our Willing or Running that can bring us within the compaſs of ſpecial Electing-grace; that being paſt, in God's Will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World was: or 2. That it condemns all Willing and Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning without having reſpect to the Mercy of God in the Goſpel, leaving out Chriſt and Grace; all ſuch willing and running will be in vain. And moſt probably this is it that is intended; for this ſutes with the ſcope of the Goſpel, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 7, 8. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5, 6, 7.</p>
                        <p>Or 3dly. That it is by the Grace and Mercy of God in the Goſpel that any do rightly will and run; Man by Nature, being ſo averſe thereunto. So that it no whit derogates from the power to will and run, but regulates it to the right way of aſſiſtance and acceptance, that is, to God that ſheweth Mercy.</p>

                        <p>And 2ly. This diſcovers the freedom of his will, relative to Sinners. After they have hardened themſelves &amp; ſined away their mercy, he is at liberty in this caſe, to ſoften in Mercy, or to harden in Judgment whom he pleaſeth. And this the Scripture, from whence the Apoſtle taketh this Sentence, doth demonſtrate, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 19. The people had all ſinned away their mercy in making a Calf: God threatened to deſtroy them all, <hi>Moſes</hi> intercedes for them: God is intreated, but takes the advantage of their ſin, and exalts Mercy and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whom he would, he would pardon, and keep alive to go into the good Land, and whom he would, ſhould not come there, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 34, 35. It's Gods Prerogative, when he pleaſe, for former ſins and abuſe of mercy (as a Judgment) to give men up to a hardened Eſtate in ſin; but ſtill this ſtands as the firm and unchangable Law of

                        <p>And <hi>verſ.</hi> 19, 20, 21. or what is elſe-where ſaid in this Chapter, we muſt underſtand to the ſame purpoſe; it ſhews the power of God over Man, in his ſinning ſtate, (where all have ſinned away their Mercy) to exerciſe Juſtice and Mercy on whom he pleaſe; not from his Eternal Will, without relation to ſin and obſtinacy, but as a puniſhment of former Rebellion, which in juſtice he might exerciſe on many, whom (probably) He will make Veſſels of Mercy.</p>
                        <p>To underſtand it otherwiſe, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That God will Damn whom he pleaſe, from his own Will and Power; and ſave whom he will, from his own Will and Power; let Men believe and obey, do what they will or can, it's all nothing; but he will (after all) have mercy on whom he will have mercy: and from his Power in his Eternal Will hath prepared ſome to Honour, and ſome to Diſhonour, without any relation to ſin or obedience, this tends not only to contradict his general Grace to Men, and the whole Law of Goſpel grace, which promiſeth Life to all that do believe and obey the Goſpel, but indeed muſt put all to a loſs; for, no man on earth can conclude (from this principle) but that after all his Willing, Running, Believing, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, Obeying, Watching and Warring, he muſt leave all to the Eternal Will and Power, who, as probably as not, had deſigned him a Veſſel of Wrath from Eternity. If it be Objected, I may be one of the ſpecially Elected Ones; I Anſwer; And, it may be, not, and then you are gone for ever, if your aſſurance ariſe not from your being under the Law-promiſe of Grace, by believing and obeying the Goſpel, but from the Eternal Will and Power of God, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Goſpel-Willing and Running, you deſtroy all Goſpel-aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Goſpel-comfort of Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p>If you ſay, You are under the Law of Goſpel-grace, the promiſe of Life by believing. I Anſwer: There you ſhould be, and there is your ſafety, and the Controverſy is over: Who-ever believes and obeys to the end, is a Veſſel of mercy. Though God may (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaid, as a puniſhment for former ſins) make ſome Veſſels of Wrath; and, to ſhew the freedom of his Will in a way of Grace, make others in the ſame ſtate, Veſſels of mercy: yet this no whit derogates from the freeneſs of Goſpel-grace, nor ſhould diſcourage any in believing and obeying the Goſpel, that they may be ſaved.</p>

It's the good VVill and Pleaſure of God, by the Goſpel, to work men to will and do His VVill therein; and this is that which ſeems to be intended in this place; for the Apoſtle exhorts them earneſtly to do the VVill of <hi>God,</hi> as the Text and Context doth demonſtrate; therefore he intends not ſuch a working, as of which they had no power or will to perform, but that as <hi>God</hi> (of his good pleaſure) had by the Goſpel wrought in them to will and do his will therein, they ſhould improve the Grace received, and in which they ſtood. To underſtand it to intend <hi>Gods</hi> working an impulſive VVill, and that they could not, or ſhould not work without it, deſtroys the Exhortation, and makes null the Duty.</p>

                        <p>That the Salvation and Damnation of Men, ſhall be ſutable to the ſeveral Miniſtrations under which they have Lived.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WE may now reſult, clearly and ſafely, that the Salvation of all that ſhall be ſaved, ſhall be ſutable to the means and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries, under which they have lived. That there hath been, and is, a ſufficiency of means of Salvation under all, is apparent, as hath been before proved; and that there was Salvation to ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all, hath been likewiſe proved, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 34, 35. This Salvation ſhall be ſutable to the means and miniſtry, and the attainments of thoſe under it, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as have been United to Chriſt by Faith, in, and under the Goſpel, are Eſpouſed to him in the neareſt Relation; a priviledge and glory, which the Gentils that have not heard of Chriſt, nor the common ſaved ones of the Jews, may be ſuppoſed to arrive unto, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 30, 31.</p>
                     <p>Yet this we muſt underſtand, that all Salvation muſt be by the Lamb ſlain, <hi>i. e.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt Crucified and Raiſed again. There hath been no miniſtration (ſimply in its ſelf) capable to ſave, but rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the Lamb ſlain, though they have been ignorant thereof, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12. and this all the Saved ones ſhall know, and Condemned ones too, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 10, 11.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Condemnation of men in the Judgment day, ſhall be for ſinning againſt God under the means and miniſtries, under which they have lived, <hi>i. e.</hi> They before the Law, and without the Law and Goſpel too, ſhall be Judged and Condemned for not improving the Miniſtry of the Creation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28. 4, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 12.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:175804:26"/> by the Law; and all Sin, ſince the Fall, hath been (in a true ſence) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Goſpel; yet their judgment muſt be by the miniſtrations, under which they have been, &amp; they ſhall then know that they ſinned againſt their Lord and Judge, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 31. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 11. Hence it's ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12. <hi>The Books were opened;</hi> that is, the Book of the Creation, and works of God, under which all had been, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 1, 2, 3, 4. and the Book of the Law, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. to 12. <hi>and another Book was opened, which was the Book of Life;</hi> this is the Book of the Goſpel, <hi>and Men were judged according to the things written in the Books.</hi> And a fourth Book may be well underſtood, <hi>i. e.</hi> The book of every man's Conſcience, that will accuſe, or excuſe at that day; and will be a Witneſs too, for, or againſt, at the day of Judgment, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15, 16.</p>
                     <p>Which ſhould be a warning to all, to take heed how they neglect the great Salvation of the Goſpel, and ſo <hi>judge themſelves unworthy of Life.</hi> Such muſt then know that the word of Salvation (which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſave them, had they believed and obeyed it) muſt be their Judge at that day, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 48 And this muſt needs be very grievous, when the word of the Goſpel, that hath ſought to ſave Sinners; and Jeſus Chriſt, who hath been thereby wooing and intreating accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſhall then Judge and Condemn them; and they themſelves ſhall then acknowledge the Judgment is juſt and right: where, will be no Plea of Non-ability in the matter, when it ſhall be found that it was their own wilfull Will that was the cauſe thereof.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Some further Conſiderations about the Eternal Judgment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to the Wicked: Whether there may be any probability from Scripture-light, of any deliverance from, or mitigation of, the Puniſhment of any after the Sentence is paſt, and the Judgment Executed.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>TOuching this, I do apprehend that there are probable grounds, both from Scripture and Reaſon, that there may be a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſome from the penal part, or pains inflicted, though not from the ſence of Loſs; the Judgment in that reſpect will be Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. The probable Scripture-grounds for this probable ſuppoſition, are as followeth.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Scripture lets us to know, that ſome ſhall be ſaved; that through their own miſcarriages ſhall loſe the reward of their work, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 14, 15. <hi>They ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo, as by fire;</hi> and what that fire is, and how far it ſhall extend, at, and after the Judgment, I muſt leave to Him that knoweth all things to determin. I know that ſome underſtand this of another day &amp; fire before the Judgment-Day: but with what Authority from Scripture, I leave the Prudent to judge, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 2. and 4. 1.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Lord of all, lets us to know, that none ſhall be Eternally Damned, but thoſe who ſin againſt the Holy Spirit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 31.

And if all ſin ſhall be forgiven, then there muſt be a deliverance from the Judgment; the unpardonable ſin is, Knowingly and malitiouſly to oppoſe Chriſt, and the Convictions and workings of the Spirit in themſelves or others, under any of the Miniſtrations, but eſpecially under the Goſpel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 24. 31. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26. 29. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20, 21, 22. <hi>Paul</hi> miſt this ſin, though he did the ſame in fact, that is, Violently oppoſe the Goſpel and Spirit of Chriſt therein; yet <hi>he did it ignorantly in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, and therefore he obtained mercy:</hi> Had he done the ſame work knowingly and maliciouſly, he had been paſt the reach of mercy.</p>

                        <p>It's true, we may not ſuppoſe the forgiveneſs of ſin, firſt or laſt, to be without Repentance, but that they ſhall be forgiven on Repentance, either here, or hereafter. 1. <hi>Here,</hi> on Repentance and Faith, and ſuch ſhall not come into Condemnation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 24. 2. <hi>Hereafter,</hi> for Chriſt ſtrongly implyeth the forgiveneſs of ſins in the World to come; <hi>He that ſinneth againſt the Holy Spirit, ſhall not be forgiven in this World, nor in the World to come:</hi> Which importeth that others ſhall be forgiven in this World, or in the World to come. 1. It importeth that there ſhall be forgiveneſs of ſins in the World to come. 2. We may not ſuppoſe that the forgiveneſs of ſins in the World to come, will be without Repentance. And 3. It is ſaid that all other ſins ſhall be forgiven, either in this world, or in that which is to come, but ſtill on the terms of Repentance, then as well as now. And that there may be forgiveneſs and acceptance after death, ſeems further to appear: elſe, What means 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19, 20. with <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 6. In <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 19, 20. it's ſaid, <hi>by which (viz.</hi> Spirit) <hi>alſo he went and Preached to the Spirits in Priſon, which ſometime were diſobedient,</hi> &amp;c. I know its commonly underſtood, the Preaching of Chriſt by <hi>Noah</hi> to the old World, to the Spirits that are now in Priſon; but it's greatly doubtful whether that be it which is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. 1. Becauſe its ſaid that He went, <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt, not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit only by <hi>Noah,</hi> but <hi>by which He went and Preached.</hi> 2. He does not ſay, He went by <hi>Noah</hi> to the people of the Old World, but <hi>he went and Preached to the Spirits</hi> (not perſons) <hi>in Priſon: Noah</hi>'s Preaching was to Perſons living, this to the Spirits in Priſon.</p>
                        <p>3dly, And eſpecially; compare this with <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 6. which ſeems to be the ſame with this; <hi>for, for this cauſe was the Goſpel Preached alſo to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the Fleſh, but live according to God in the Spirit.</hi> Where the Apoſtle ſtates theſe things: 1. <hi>That the Goſpel was Preached to them that are dead.</hi> 2. The time When it was Preached to them; that was, after they were dead; that is apparent from theſe expreſſions: 1. It's plainly expreſt, <hi>It was Preached to them that are dead.</hi> 2. <hi>That they might be judged according to,</hi> (or as) <hi>men in the Fleſh,</hi> viz. that they were judged (in this matter) as if they had been alive in the Fleſh, which imports they were not. 3. The end of the Goſpel's being Preached unto them, was, <hi>that they might live to God in the Spirit;</hi> and if ſo, it clearly imports that there may be ſome hopes of ſome relief, ſome

This Scripture tells us not when it was, whether before, or after his Suffering. 2. It ſaith not, that his Soul went and Preached, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but He, <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt in Perſon by the Spirit, as he did all his works here among men, even by the ſame Spirit he went and Preached, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3.

                        <p n="4">4. The Scripture preſents us with the deliverance of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> in ſome time, from the greatneſs of their Judgment: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. ſpeaking of the greatneſs of their Judgment, and of <hi>Samaria,</hi> v. 46. 49. he promiſeth a Reſtauration to them both, out of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn eſtate, <hi>v.</hi> 55. 61. This is ſpoken of literal <hi>Sodom,</hi> and cannot be myſtically applied: Compare this with <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15. where Chriſt, the Lord and Judge, alloweth a tolerableneſs for <hi>Sodom</hi> at that day, more than for Sinners againſt the Goſpel; which being compared with the former Scripture, ſeems to give ſome light unto it, <hi>(viz.)</hi> how far <hi>Sodom</hi> may be tolerated at that day, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 23, 24. And the rather may we thus underſtand it, becauſe <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith) <hi>Jude</hi> v. 7) that they <hi>are ſuffering the Vengeance of Eternal fire,</hi> and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture promiſeth a time of deliverance.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Why may we not ſuppoſe, that God may in time, be pacified toward Sinners, after they have born their Sin and Judgment, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly he hath declared himſelf to be, or will be in time to come? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 58. <hi>Thou haſt born thy leudneſs, and thine abominations, that is, the puniſhment of thy lewdneſs,</hi> v. 63. <hi>that thou maiſt remember and be confounded when I am pacified towards thee:</hi> and <hi>chap.</hi> 39. 6. Seeing God hath been (or will be) pacified in Judgment, why ſhould we ſuppoſe him to be unreconcileable, and never to be pacified in his laſt and great Judgment?</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The Scripture ſaith expreſly, <hi>That God is the Saviour of all men, but eſpecially of thoſe that believe;</hi> and it is not preſent outward Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:175804:28"/> the Apoſtle is there ſpeaking of, but very probably the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all, out of the faln ſtate in the Reſurrection, and of all in His times, from the greatneſs of the Judgment, that are not excepted in his Word.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. That (probably) all ſins of Ignorance (if not wilful) are herein comprehended, as in times to be forgiven, which ſeems to be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Reaſon: For, if <hi>Sodom</hi> had enjoyed the means of Light, as ſome others did, they had Repented, and the Judgment been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and <hi>Sodom</hi> had remained, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 23. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 13. So that ſuch as might, or would have Repented, had they had the means of Light as ſome others, may have a time for mercy; and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeems to preſent us with this, that all (except ſuch as ſin wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and knowingly againſt God) may have a time for remitting the penal part of their Judgment, after they have born the puniſhment of their ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. It's not intended, that this Deliverance will extend to any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of glory, but only a deliverance from pain and miſery, for they are under no promiſe of reward of good works (becauſe they had none) &amp; therefore muſt juſtly ſuffer the reward of their bad works, but no reward of any good, and, on this account, muſt be under the Eternal Judgment and ſence of Loſs.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. And that, what of favour and mercy may be extended on this account, ſhall be on the account, and for the ſake of Chriſt: He ſhall have the honour of all acts of grace to Eternity, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 10. and this, as it ſeems to be Scriptural, ſo it ſeems to be rational and moſt God-like, Who is the Fountain of Reaſon and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and as he hath let us to know that he will ſute his Judgments (as a Righteous Judge) ſutable to mens various facts for meaſure, which is a rational and righteous way of Juſtice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 47, 48. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 12.

There can be no greater ſtumbling Block in the way of Sinners, than to ſuppoſe, That God, in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, willed the Salvation of, but very few; it may be, not one in a thouſand; nay, not (probably, according to their Principle) one in Ten thouſand: A great Block is this in the hopeful way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of poor Sinners. And if it be ſuppoſed, that ſo few are like to be ſaved; yet if this Block be removed, the Fault will reſt in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not on God: Therefore (I ſay) let there be no Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple owned, nor Doctrine publiſhed, nor any thing Practiſed in the Converſation, that may prove juſtly ſtumbling, either to Saints or Sinners; that Sinners be not thereby kept at a diſtance from the Truth, nor <hi>the Lame turned out of the Way,</hi> Heb, 12. 13.

                  <p>HAving obſerved (to my grief) the Differences, among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, about matters of Faith and Worſhip; notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, we have all Grounds to fear, that we are All (in ſome things) in the Dark; being but coming out of the Mystical <hi>Babylon,</hi> and Apoſtacy. And, What Perſon or Church can ſay, They are in all things delivered from the Deſilement of that Eſtate? but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are travelling from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Zion:</hi> And, O that we could go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in more <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity; going, and weeping, to ſeek the Lord our God; and asking the Way to <hi>Zion,</hi> with our Faces thither-ward, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 4, 5. Not judging, and cenſuring one another; becauſe, all have not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained alike Apprehenſion, in and about the Way: Some think they have gotten a ſtep beyond their Fellows; And hence they deſpiſe, or too much undervalue thoſe they think to come ſhort of them: And thoſe, who may (probably) come ſhort of others in ſome Principles of Truth, judge thoſe, who (it may be) are gotten beyond them: And thus it's to be feared, that Chriſtians have ſinned much in their Conteſtings, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachings, Judgings, Dividings, and Separating one from another: even to the utmost Extent, the Scripture warrants a Separation from the World and <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have here endeavonred to put my poor Helping-hand, for Healing (if't may be) the Wounds, and binding up the Breaches, and Controverſies of <hi>Zion,</hi> of the Church. And, O that it may be of Healing <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, and as a Medicine fitly applyed! It's not a Scriptureleſs <hi>Peace</hi> I plead for; but a juſt and lawful <hi>Peace,</hi> a Chriſtian <hi>Peace:</hi> Not to throw Churches into Confuſion; but that they may not Confound each other; that they may not bite, and devour each other.</p>

                  <p> I have endeavoured an Anſwer to the moſt ſpecial things in uſe at this Day; on which, Separations among Churches, and Chriſtians, are built: My reaſon here-in is, not (in the leaſt) to provoke, but to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate; that ſo, my deſigned End herein might be accompliſhed, <hi>viz.</hi> That thoſe who break on thoſe Grounds, might (at leaſt) unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

I hope, the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-ſpirited will come to ſee the little Grounds they have to make Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, with their Brethren about theſe matters: I heartily deſire, it may prove a Healing-Word to All, through the Bleſſing of Him that hath dwelt in the burning Buſh, ſo as that it is not yet conſumed. I ſhall here give no further account of the Matter, or Method of the following Diſcourſe: It's very brief; and hath waited an opportunity, of coming into Publick, for ſome Years; but, for ſome Reaſons, hath layn in ſilence till this time; hoping that the preceding Diſcourſe, may tend to add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this Eſſay for Peace.

                     <p>The Grounds of Church-Fellow-ſhip, or thoſe Principles on which the Church, or Churches of Chriſt, ſhould Ground and Bound their Communion, are moſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtated in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6. The reaſon why I (eſpecially) fix on this Scripture is, becauſe it ſeems to be ſtated (not only) as an Argument to engage to the Unity exhorted to, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. but is (like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) a Deſcription wherein this Unity doth conſiſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Of the Unity of the Church it ſelf, <hi>There is one Body,</hi> i. e. one Church, which is the Body of Chriſt; and of whom He is the true and lawful Head, Lord, and Law-giver, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. Which Church containes all true Believers, in all Nations: This is the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church of Chriſt, in the Viſible Profeſſion of the Faith of Chriſt, according to the beſt of their Underſtanding, and Knowledg of the Will of Chriſt, their Head and Lord, in His Word: Though, in this Church, as thus conſidered, ſome may miſcarry; and, by
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:175804:38"/> their own Default, come ſhort of the Glory promiſed.</p>
                     <p>This Univerſal Church is thus deſcribed, in the Text laſt mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and in <hi>verſ.</hi> 27, and in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22, 23. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18.</p>

There is but one true Univerſal Goſpel-Church in the World, which is the Body of Chriſt; and of this Church it is, I do profeſs my ſelf a Member: And this Church is (or ſhould be) gathered into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, or Congregations; walking according to the Rules and Laws of Chriſt, their Head and Lord: Holding Communion with Chriſt, their Head; one with another; and with all Churches in the ſame Faith, and Obedience of the Goſpel. And as for the great matters of Faith, wherein the Churche's Unity conſiſteth, it here followeth:</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p>
                        <hi>5thly. One Baptiſm;</hi> that is, either, 1.

                     <p>
                        <hi>6thly. One God, and Father of All; who is above All, and through All, and in you All.</hi> Now, where there is a Unity in theſe principal Things <hi>(viz. One Spirit,</hi> uniting this <hi>one Body, one Hope, one Lord Jeſus, one Baptiſm, one God, and Father of All,</hi> &amp;c.) there is a Ground for Church-Communion, in all the things of Jeſus Chriſt, if other matters of Scandal, in Converſation, do not juſtly prevent, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 5, to 12.</p>
                     <p>Our Lord ſums up the Fundamentals, neceſſary to Salvation, in a narrow Compaſs. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. <hi>And this is Life Eternal, that they know thee, the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent;</hi> which (doubtleſs) includes the Whole, of Faith and Practice, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary unto Life Eternal: And <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>He that Believeth, and is Baptized, ſhall be Saved;</hi> that is, He that Believeth, and Obeyeth the Lord in the Goſpel, ſhall be Saved; of which Obedience, Baptiſm is the firſt, and an Uſher to all other Parts of Obedience; and that which, by the Goſpel-Law, puts Perſons under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Salvation, and gives them a right to orderly Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
                     <p>So that I infer from the Premiſes, That, according to the Rule of Scripture, and Law of Chriſt, nothing ſhould prevent thoſe that are united in the Faith and Baptiſm of Chriſt (walking according there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto) from Fellowſhip, in all the Ordinances, and Priviledges of the Church. And truly I do fear, that it hath been the great ſin, and miſcarriage of Chriſtians, to make other things (as their own private Opinions) too much the Ground of their Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:175804:39"/> (which hath been one cauſe of many Breaches, among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and Churches). And hence it comes to paſs, that (almoſt) ſo many Opinions, ſo many Churches, which gives occaſion of ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling to ſome; and to others, to triumph, and ſay, <hi>A-hah;</hi> ſo would we have it; (A wonderful ſin and ſhame it is): And, as theſe are the Grounds, ſo they are the Bounds, of Goſpel-Church-Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I ſee not how we may, by the Goſpel-Law, go without theſe Bounds in Goſpel-Church-Fellowſhip, and Communion, in the Church-Ordinances, and Priviledges of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of Laying on of Hands on all Baptized Believers.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Shall now come to ſpeak ſomething to thoſe ſeveral Perſons and Churches, ſeparated and diſtinguiſhed, according to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Opinions, that may tend to moderate in this matter: As for <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> it being (almoſt) generally granted, to be an indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ordinance of Chriſt, in order to Viſible-Church-Communion; or a Viſible- giving up our ſelves to God, after Believing: I ſhall therefore take it for granted, that all, who own Jeſus Chriſt to be their Saviour and Lord, do own <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in Water to be his holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and none will deny it to follow Faith, according to the Law of Chriſt; though too many practiſe the contrary, as to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: <hi>viz.</hi> Take Infants inſtead of Believers.</p>
                     <p>The firſt I ſhall ſpeak unto, are thoſe who practiſe Impoſition of Hands on all Baptized Believers, as the Law of Chriſt; and on this Ground ſeparate from all, who, in Conſcience, cannot ſo act with them. And for ſuch, I have ſeen ſeveral of their Writings; and had ſome Converſe with ſome of them; ſome more moderate, and ſome more rigid; ſome making it a ground of Separation, and ſome not.</p>
                     <p>The Grounds, I find, on which that Practice is ſtated are, that of <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. and the Practice of the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 17, and 19. 6. I ſhall endeavour to diſcourſe this Matter, with all the Clearneſs and Moderation I can; to the intent, that all gracious Souls may (at leaſt) ſee the little ground there is to make Breaches and Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:175804:39"/> about it; though I do exceedingly own tenderneſs of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God-ward, in all His Will.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As for <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. (from whence, I ſuppoſe, are ſeveral Miſtakes urged in this Matter: As, firſt, ſuppoſing it to be the only Deſign of the Apoſtle here-in, to ſtate the Grounds, and Bounds, of Church-Communion); though it is ſo, that moſt of the things here-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned are the great matters of Faith and Practice; yet, it's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that it is rather letting the Church to know, That if they drew back, and fell away, there was no renewing of them to thoſe things again: And therefore, (though they were very much degenerated, as is apparent, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 12.) the Apoſtle would leave theſe Things, and not teach them anew; but, <hi>go on to Perfection;</hi> that is, Go on to teach them further Goſpel-Truths, as <hi>verſ</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5, 10, 11. 8, 7. to the end of the Epiſtle, doth Demonſtrate.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Miſtake is, in ſo frequently calling thoſe things Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and Foundation-Principles, to be all alike practiſed in all Ages of the Church; whereas Jeſus Chriſt is the alone Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. And this is clear in the Text: It ſaith not, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Faith, and Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is the Foundation; But, <hi>not Laying again the Foundation of theſe Things;</hi> that is, Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: He is the Foundation of Repentance <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For, without Him, there is no ground for any of theſe, nor for our Acceptation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: It's all Founded in Him: Therefore, the Scripture ſaith not, Laying of theſe things as the Foundation; But, <hi>not Laying again the Foundation of theſe Things; which is Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> And, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Miſtake, Men perſwade themſelves and others, that, not to come up fully and practically, in all theſe beginning-Words, is to take away the Foundations of the Building; by reaſon of which, it muſt needs Fall.</p>
                     <p>A third miſtake is, That the beginning-things the Apoſtles did, are indiſpenſibly to be practiſed in the Church through-out all Ages; and from hence, becauſe the Apoſtles practiſed this of Impoſition of hands, it muſt continue as an Ordinance in the Church, of the ſame Authority and continuance as Baptiſm: and hence ſeparate from thoſe who (in their notions) come not to the ſame Faith and Practice.</p>
                     <p>Now that this is a mere miſtake, and that there are Beginning-things practiſed by the Apoſtles (of which, this is one, as will in its place appear) which are not practicable by us, is moſt evident; for if it were not ſo, it would ſet all a-ſeeking, and not find; to inſtance, The
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:175804:40"/> Apoſtles did many miracles, and ſome of them were by Impoſition of hands, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 17, 18. &amp; 28. 8. If we hence reaſon (as ſome do) that there are now no true Miniſters, but ſuch as can do ſuch mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, there would be no Miniſtry at all, and ſo no Church; and we might all go a-ſeeking, and not find: In the beginning of the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, there was ſuch varieties of Gifts in the Church, as now is not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28, 29. And if it be neceſſary that theſe gifts be in the Church at all times, then now there can be no Church, and they that ſo affirm, are juſtified: But we are to underſtand that the Goſpel-Church, intends one and the ſame Church-ſtate from firſt to laſt, as the ſtate of the Jewiſh Church was, and was ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſs glorious, from varieties and occaſions; ſo that the Apoſtles, and Gifts, and Miracles were for us as well as them, and are as truly ours as theirs, being the ſame Church-ſtate; ſo that there is no more need for thoſe firſt Miracles and Gifts to continue, and to be repeated over in every Age (relative to the Church) than was of <hi>Moſes</hi> in Perſon; and thoſe amazing miracles from Mount<hi>-Sinai,</hi> to be repeated over in every Generation after: by all which, it appears, that all the beginning-Words and Works of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles are not eſſential to the Church-ſtate in every Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but ſome of them only to be believed, but not practiſed, becauſe it cannot be: of which, this will appear to be one.</p>
                     <p>A fourth miſtake is, in ſo poſitively affirming that the Impoſition of hands in this Scripture, is, and muſt be intended, 1. Of that on all Believers as ſuch, being Baptized. 2. To be done as an Ordinance of Chriſt, of conſtant and univerſal practice as is Baptiſm; to theſe, ſeveral conſcionable doubts may be made,</p>
                     <p>As 1. Whether Impoſition of hands on Believers, as ſuch, be at all intended in this Scripture; and that 1. Becauſe we do not find laying on of hands on Believers as ſuch, at all practiſed in that Church; and for us to conclude that to be intended, which we do not find practiſed among them, muſt needs be an uncertain conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That it was not practiſed, ſeems evident, not only from its not being mentioned, but likewiſe from the Promiſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be Baptized, every one of you, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the holy Spirit.</hi> He does not ſay, be Baptized, and have hands laid on you, but be Baptized, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By which it appears that Baptiſm is that to which the Promiſe is made, and not laying on of hands; and its not to be doubted, but that they had the gift (according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe)

And in that Scripture, one of the beginning-VVords (or Principles) are Baptiſms, which muſt intend the Baptiſm of Gifts as one; which, I dare be bold to ſay, no men on Earth have: So that, if there be a Baptiſm among theſe beginning-Things, which no man on Earth hath attained, and the end of the Apoſtles Laying on of Hands, was in order to this Baptiſm, and no man can attain it without the Gift of God; and yet there is a Church in preſent being without it: So, may there be as truly a Church, without Laying on of Hands, which was in order to it; for, the Form adds nothing without the Power; eſpecially, in this caſe, where the Formal Act was uſed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in way of Power: And for Perſons to lay on Hands to ſuch an end, who have not the Gifts themſelves, ſeems altogether Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and Reaſonleſs.</p>
                        <p>And what is ſaid in this Matter, of the Judgment of Authors, both Antient and Modern, proves nothing; it being known, that the Apoſtacy was enter'd timely into the Church; and hath made ſo great an alteration, and change, from the Primitive Rule and Power; that, although there is ſomething like the Truth, yet the true Form and Power of Truth is loſt. The Lord help His People, that in their coming out, they bring away none of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Devices with them; which, I greatly fear, they are too much inclined unto.</p>
                        <p>But to conclude this Matter; From all theſe Conſiderations, I muſt ſay, That I dare not meddle with this, having no Authority from the Lord for it: I cannot do it in His Name, without His Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, leſt my Act ſhould be of the ſame kind as thoſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 13, to 16.

                        <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who was <hi>the Apoſtle of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>in Faith, and Verity,</hi> Rom. 11. 13. 1 Tim. 2. 7. tells us, that he <hi>had not ceaſed to make known all the Counſel of God,</hi> Act. 27 with <hi>verſ.</hi> 20.

                        <p>And as for that other Objection, from <hi>Matt.</hi> 24. 20. where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Pray that your Flight be not on the Sabbath-Day,</hi> it's ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily Anſwered, 1. That it's no Command for the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> take it in the ſtricteſt ſenſe that may be ſuppoſed. 2. It's evident, that Chriſt intends it relative to the Jews, who he knew would be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> and ſo their trouble would be the greater: It no whit adds Authority to the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> but relates the Difficulty of their Caſe, by reaſon of the zealous Jews, who would be (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably) as ready to kill ſuch as would flee on that Day, as the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And, as for the Apoſtles Preaching on that Day to the Jews, it is no marvel, nor ground to conclude it Inſtituted, for the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day of Divine-Worſhip; whoſe Work it was, to take all Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, both among the Jews &amp; Gentiles, to be winning Souls to Chriſt, any Day, or Time, of their Aſſembling, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 20, 21. But ſhew any one Example of a Goſpel-Church, aſſembling on that Day, to worſhip God in Praying, Preaching, and breaking Bread, or Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the Lord's-Supper; it would be ſomething nearer the Matter, though not enough to make it an Ordinance.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>6thly.</hi> We have not only the Silence of Chriſt, and His Apoſtles, both as to the Precept, and Precedent; but we have many words dropt by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epiſtles, ſeemingly to the contrary, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5. <hi>One Man eſteemeth one Day above another, another eſteemeth every Day alike;</hi> that is, Eſteemeth no Holineſs in one Day above another, and ſo leaves it as a matter indifferent. <hi>Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one be fully perſwaded in his own Mind,</hi> and not judge, or deſpiſe one another: Some, I know, will ſay to this, That it intends other Legal-Daies, formerly obſervable; But who can Determine this? Seeing the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in the largeſt ſenſe, <hi>Eſteemeth every Day alike?</hi> There is no room for the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to be excepted: And, it's not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the Gentile-Believers ſhould ſo ſoon fall in love with the leſſer Holy-Dayes of the Jews, and not with the greater; So that, the Seventh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Day, is the moſt likely to be the one Day (by ſome) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed above the reſt.</p>

                        <p>But for the Seventh-Day <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> they were commonly, called <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and <hi>Sabbath-Dayes,</hi> in the Old-Teſtament, as they are in the Text, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16.

                           <hi>7thly.</hi> And after all this, Having given ſo many Hints of Liberty about it, and of its Ceſſation, and ſo to leave it; and not any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to open his Mind about it, to let us know, that, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he thus ſpake; yet he intended, that the Seventh-Day ſhould be kept as a <hi>Sabbath</hi> ſtill: I ſay, Can we imagine, that both Chriſt, and the Apoſtle, ſhould leave us thus in the Dark, in this ſo weighty a Matter, if ſtill to be continued? That which was ſo plainly Stated, &amp; ſo often Repeated, and Inculcated, in the Old-Teſtament, when in force, and nothing at all in the New; but ſo much to the contrary, if it had been to be obſerved? Surely, I cannot, I dare not, think it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>8thly,</hi> and laſtly, From the Whole I conclude, That we have no ground in the New-Teſtament, to obſerve the Seventh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Day <hi>Sabbath;</hi> and therefore, Men have no ground to ſeparate from their Brethren, that cannot follow them in this Matter: And, I hope, this will be of uſe unto them, (at leaſt) to moderate them, and to Repent of the Breaches made on this account; that, if their Faith continue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, they will have it to themſelves.

                     <p n="1">1. The Old-Teſtament-Scriptures, ſtated in this matter, ſeem to come ſhort of a New-Teſtament-Law; and that for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, 1.

True it is, there is the ſame dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſtill, of being turned away from the Truth; and therefore, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ought to be very careful herein.</p>
                     <p>2dly. Come we to the New-Teſtament, and we have no poſitive Law ſtated in this matter: The Scriptures urged, reach not the caſe in hand, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 26, 27. I verily think, it's a great miſtake in thoſe who think that Chriſt there ſpeaks of unlawful Marriages, or of the ſins of the laſt Dayes; but, rather diſcovers the ſtate of the World, as not expecting His Coming; that, as a ſnare, it will come upon them, when they are not aware: And 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14. clearly relates to Fellowſhip on a Church-account, and the Churches Concernment; not to mix with Idolaters, or falſe Worſhippers in Religious-Worſhip, and nothing at all of Marriages. Neither does 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 8. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 29. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2 14. at all reach the caſe in hand; only that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 39. ſeems to have ſomething of this Matter in it. The unmarryed Woman, being a Widdow, is at liberty to be Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to whom ſhe will, <hi>Only in the Lord:</hi> Yet, whether to underſtand the words, <hi>Only in the Lord,</hi> to intend only with a Church-Member, is the great Queſtion, which ſome cannot ſo eaſily paſs over; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther underſtand it to intend, in the Fear of the Lord, as His Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: And that, 1. Becauſe (though the word [in the Lord,] and [in Chriſt], do moſtly intend in the Faith, &amp; Profeſſion, of the Lord,) the word <hi>In the Lord,</hi> is never ſpoken of a Second Perſon, <hi>viz.</hi> When it ſpeaks of any Perſon, doing any Act, as <hi>In the Lord,</hi> it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the ſame Perſon, and not another: So, when it ſpeaks of the Woman's Marrying In the Lord, it intends her own Act, and not the Perſon with whom ſhe Marryeth, That he muſt be <hi>in the Lord,</hi> i. e. in the Church 2. Becauſe there are other-like ſayings in Scripture, that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:175804:49"/> muſt be thus underſtood, <hi>viz.</hi> The Fear of the Lord, according to Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Appointment and Ordinance, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 11. <hi>Nevertheleſs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Man without the Woman, neither the Woman without the Man, in the Lord: In the Lord,</hi> in this Place, cannot intend in the Faith, and Profeſſion, of the Lord; For ſo, <hi>Paul</hi> was without a Wife, and perſwaded others, both Men, and Women, ſo to be; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, it brings not only Worldly Troubles, but Diſtraction in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Things; which clearly importeth, That they might be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out each other, as in the Church; and that, to the beſt advantage, on the Religious account. But, as <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. do fully explain, They cannot be without each other, on the Worldly-account, for Procre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and maintaining the World, which is God's Ordinance: And to do it in the Way of Marriage, is to do it <hi>in the Lord: For, the Woman is of the Man, and the Man is by the Woman; but both, of God:</hi> Taking, and living together, <hi>In the Lord,</hi> i. e. in Lawful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and not in Adultery, is to Marry <hi>in the Lord,</hi> Heb. 13. 4. So, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Children Obey your Parents, in the Lord:</hi> It cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their Parents in the Church only; then it would be a Law of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and Diſobedience, to Parents out of the Church: But, <hi>In the Lord,</hi> relates to the Children themſelves, to do it in the Fear of the Lord, as His Ordinance, in all lawful, and rightful Things, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Parents be in, or out of the Church. So, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Wives, ſubmit your ſelves unto your own Husbands, as it is fit in the Lord,</hi> muſt be thus underſtood, <hi>viz.</hi> of Wive's Submiſſion, in Lawful Things to their Husbands, in the fear of the Lord; and that to thoſe out of the Profeſſion of the Lord, as well as to thoſe in the Church, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
                     <p>3dly. There are many Sayings in Scripture, which ſeem to take off the force of what ſeems to be ſaid to the contrary; as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 2. <hi>Let every Man have his own Wife, and every Woman her own Husband.</hi> He doth not limit, to the Church; compared with <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14 where the <hi>unbelieving-Husband, and the unbelieving-Wife, are Sanctified to each other's</hi> uſe in that Relation. And, what is ſaid in this matter, is but a Suppoſition, and no inſallible Concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſuch as were Marryed before Believing; and urged from <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>Let every one abide in the ſame Calling, wherein they were called.</hi> This is but a Suppoſition, and no undoubted Concluſion: But <hi>v.</hi> 17. ſeems more proper to this caſe, <hi>But as God hath Diſtributed to every Man,</hi> (or Divided); which ſeems to relate moſt properly to the matter of Marriage; it being God's Diſtribution, (whether the Husband, or VVife, be good or bad), one in Mercy, the other in Judgment: And, to this like wiſe, agreeth 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1, 2. which fully cleareth,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:175804:50"/> That believing-VVomen, had unbelieving-Husbands; but, whether marryed before Believing, is unintelligible, as to us, unleſs by Divine-Revelation; which now, none can pretend unto.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>4thly.</hi> Marriage it ſelf, is of Natural, and VVorldly concernment, (and not Religious, any other-wiſe, than Eating, and Drinking, which is God's Ordinance) and, by Chriſtians to be done in the Lord, <hi>viz.</hi> in His Fear, with Prayer, and Thankſgiving, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 4, 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. Religion, in both Parties, adds to the Comfort of the Relation; but not to the Being thereof.</p>
                     <p>That it's of VVorldly Concernment in it ſelf, is clear, not only from Reaſon, but from the Scripture, <hi>Luk</hi> 20. 34 <hi>The Children of this World Marry, and are given in Marriage.</hi> Though, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, the Kingdom of Chriſt is diſtinct from the VVorld, and is not of the VVorld; and the Children of Light, diſtinct from the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this VVorld: Yet in this, and in many other Caſes, as Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, and in VVorldly Employments, they are as the Children of this World, and act as in the Faln-ſtate; though Grace directs them to a higher end in all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. than they, who are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Children of this World, do attain unto. Yet Marriage both of good &amp; bad is a Worldly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>work, &amp; performed by the Children of this World, one with another, to Worldly-ends; as you may ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 28. &amp; 2. 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 2. Which ends of Marriage, Men &amp; Women (on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ſo) are capable to perform. Neither can I be of the mind of thoſe who judg ſuch Marriages to be poſitively unlawful, and ſinful; and yet, that it is unlawful for ſuch to be ſeparated one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (the grounds ſtated, not reaching the Caſe); For, if it were ſo, I do not yet underſtand, How any Repentance, (for a Fact done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law of God) can be accounted true, without Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; How the Way can be made plain over this Block, I know not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>5thly.</hi> The Caſe with us much differs, from what it was in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times; all then (of the Gentiles) that were not of the Church, were of the Idolatrous Heathens; yet ſome Believing-Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands had Unbelieving-Wives and ſome Believing-Wives had ſuch Unbelieving-Husbands: But now, all profeſs Chriſtianity; and, in a ſenſe, may be ſaid to be Believers. And, in all the differing Opinions about the VVays; and VVorſhip of God as Chriſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there may be ſome fearing God among All; For, God hath His People in <hi>Babylon,</hi> Rev. 18. 4. And ſo,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>6thly.</hi> Hence it comes to paſs, That ſome Husbands, and VVives, prove better, and more comfortable Yoke-Fellows in that Relation, that are not Church-Members, than ſome that are; though a ſhame,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:175804:50"/> and reproof it is to Church-Members that it is ſo: And indeed, ſome Church-Members become vile and wicked, and worſe Relations than is ordinary among the worſt of Men; which renders the uncertainty of Comfort to Chriſtians, in their Relations, in this matter; though (both religiouſly, rationally, and ordinarily) it may be expected better: Yet, I have ſeen as great diſappointments on this account, as of any by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying out of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Yet, <hi>7thly.</hi> and finally; I would not be miſ underſtood by any: For, I judg it to be moſt ſuitable, moſt religious, moſt honourable, and moſt likely for Peace and Comfort, for all ſorts of Opinions (in matters of Religion), to unite in this near Relation, where Unity may be both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly, and rationally, expected; though I earneſtly deſire more Love among all Chriſtians of differing Apprehenſions; and that Perſons uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Marriage, of differing Perſwaſions, may perform the ſeveral Duties of each other of that Relation. Yet, it ſavours moſt of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that our neareſt Relations be ſuch, as with whom we may walk, and worſhip God, <hi>as Heirs together of the Grace of Life,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 7.</p>
                     <p>And as for the matter of Oaths, in the Caſes of late, commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, and on which, hath been many Breaches; I believe if Perſons knew what it is to walk by Rule, and not by Will, this matter will be ſoon over; though Repentance is needed for the uncharitable Breaches on this account.</p>
                     <p>And as for Blood, and Things ſtrangled; though I am much of the ſame mind, that Blood is forbidden; and that on the ſame grounds as mentioned; <hi>viz.</hi> That which was forbidden before the Law, under the Law, and under the Goſpel, muſt needs be unlawful; <hi>viz.</hi> That which was ever unlawful, muſt be ſo ſtill, without ſome new Law to make it lawful: And I may add, That Blood was at firſt forbidden on a Moral (and not a Ceremonial) ground, <hi>viz. The Blood is the Life thereof,</hi> Gen. 9. 4. So it was, and ſo it is, the Life ſtill. The Law of forbidding Blood is as antient, as the Law of allowance to eat the Fleſh; and is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law to mankind, not Ceremonial, but Moral, and Perpetual: Yet, notwithſtanding, I ſee no ground of Separation; from Perſons, or Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that are of another mind; not only, becauſe ſuch things are not ſtated as the ground of Fellowſhip; but like-wiſe, we are forbidden to make Breaches on ſuch accounts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. And becauſe, there are various Expreſſions in the Scripture, which, many, yea moſt of the Godly underſtand gives an allowance in this matter; and think it weakneſs in thoſe who make Conſcience thereof, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 14. <hi>I know, and am perſwaded, by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that there is nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean of it ſelf; viz.</hi> by any Law of God: For, it is Legal-Uncleanneſs
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:175804:51"/> that is here intended: And that the firſt Part of that Injunction of the Apoſtles, Elders, and Church <hi>(Act.</hi> 15. 28, 29.) forbidding the eating of Things offered to Idols, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is in ſome caſe allowed elſe-where; and forbidden only in caſe of Offence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 4. 8, 9. &amp; 10. 27, 28, 29. 32. Though, as for my ſelf, I can ſatisfiedly underſtand theſe Scriptures, and the Law againſt eating of Blood ſtand unaltered; yet, I durſt not force my underſtanding on others; nor with-draw from thoſe who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from me herein. And I heartily deſire, that all the true Lovers of Truth, and Peace, would not make diſputable and doubtful Things, the cauſes of Diviſion; but to <hi>receive each other, not to doubtful Diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> Rom. 14. 1. knowing that <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven conſiſteth not in Meat and Drink, but in Righteouſneſs, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Spirit,</hi> Rom. 14. 17.</p>
                     <p>And as for theſe grand cauſes of Diviſion, <hi>viz.</hi> The differing Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about Election, ſpecial and general Grace, I hope what I have ſaid about this matter, in the preceding Diſcourſe, may tend (in time) to help over thoſe Extreams; when others ſhall ſee cauſe, to ſet to their helping-hand in this Matter.</p>

                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:175804:51"/>
                     <p> But this I am willing to hope, That ſuch as are Godly among all that thus practice, when they coometſee, how inconſiſtent, Infant-Baptiſm is, with that of Believers; and that they holding the firſt, on ſolid Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounds, which are innumerable; &amp; the Second (at beſt), but on ſuppoſed grounds; and that, in ſo much Inconſiſtency, and Contradiction, both to the Thing it ſelf, and true ſtate of the Goſpel-Church, who are, or ſhould be, all (at leaſt) Profeſt-Believers, <hi>called to be Saints;</hi> I ſay, I am willing to hope, That when they come to ſee into theſe (ſo great) Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they will be as willing, and ready to lay down, and fall in, with the Goſpel-Practice, as ever they were to withſtand it.</p>
                     <p>And, <hi>2dly.</hi> I am willing to hope, That they will (for time to come) be more heedful of oppoſing, reproaching, and perſecuting a People, for owning, and practiſing, their profeſt-Principles; if they ſuppoſe weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in thoſe that cannot, in Conſcience, fall-in with their Practice of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm; whiles, they are ſure, it is Truth they fall-in with, in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever's-Baptiſm, I hope they may come to ſee it, not ſo great a Crime, as they perſwade themſelves, and others, it is; eſpecially, in as much, as they cannot, nor pretend not to Infallibility in the Matter. I would therefore, humbly pray all ſuch ſerious and godly Perſons, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to ponder this Matter, and to ſearch after the Mind of the Lord herein, in order to the true Goſpel-Peace of the Church, that there may be no more biting and devouring one of another; and to try, how they can reconcile their own Principles in this Matter; and to weigh all in the Ballance of the Sanctuary; and what ever is found too light there, to let it go as it is; and to be of a <hi>Caleb,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua-</hi>like ſpirit, <hi>to follow God fully:</hi> And above all, to take heed of an oppoſing perſecuting-Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. I am perſwaded, that a Goſpel-Spirit, and Perſecution, can, or do, rarely dwell together in one Man: To Perſecute, or uſe a Coercive-Power in matters of Religion, is inconſiſtent with the Chriſtian-Church, relative to Chriſt the Head, and Lord thereof; who uſes not Worldly-Weapons (or Power) in His Kingdom, or Church: Neither hath He Authoriſed His Miniſters ſo to do. Worldly-Government, is to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with Worldly-Power: Chriſt's-Government in His Church, by His Word and Spirit, adminiſtring His Cenſures in His Name: So that, to uſe Coercive-Power, in Chriſt's immediate Concerns in His Church, derogates from His Authority; and, it like-wiſe derogates from the true Nature of His Church, which are His Sheep. For Sheep, under any pretence, to perſecute Wolves (or pretended Wolves); yet it ſhews forth a Wolviſh-nature: And how Perſecuters can acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Wolves, though in Sheep's-Cloathings, I know not: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, take heed and beware of a perſecuting-ſpirit; and fall-in with
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:175804:52"/> Truth; <hi>Love the Truth and Peace.</hi> This I muſt ſay, That, were there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to make a Difference, I could never hold Communion with a Perſecuting-Church; it being ſo contrary to the Spirit and Word of the Goſpel, and State of the true Goſpel-Church, who did never perſecute; but was always perſecuted for Chriſt, and the Truth's ſake.</p>
                     <p>And whereas it's ſaid, That thoſe which pretend to be againſt Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do the ſame in words, and evil-ſpeakings, which is as truly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the Tongue, as any other way of Perſecution. This I muſt ſay, 1. I am much of the ſame mind, that there hath been too much of this amongſt us All; and, as our Lord ſaid in another Caſe, He that hath not offended in this matter <hi>let him throw the firſt-ſtone:</hi> And cauſe we have all to be humbled, and to repent of this Evil. Yet, <hi>2dly,</hi> we muſt contend earneſtly (yet humbly in the Goſpel-ſpirit), <hi>for the Faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> Jude v. 3. And I earneſtly deſire All, who fear God, to manifeſt Truth of Love to all People; eſpecially, ſuch as have the Viſible-appearance of Godlyneſs, according to the Goſpel, in their differing-ways; though, on a Church-account, conſtituted, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Goſpel-Rule. I do not yet underſtand, how there can be a walking-together in Church-Worſhip, without a Unity in that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and in the one ſort of Members that are to be exerciſed therein; whithout which, I ſee no way for the Church, to be either conſtituted or preſerved, according to the Goſpel-Law, and Order: Yet, there ſhould be a great heedfulneſs of unchriſtianing each other, (unleſs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons unchriſtian themſelves by prophaneneſs.) nor to account each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Enemies; but converſe together, and love as Brethren: For, I truly deſire, That, among all the differing-Apprehenſions, all that hold to the Head Chriſt Jeſus (and that call on His Name), may ſtudy the Things that make for Peace, (forſaking the quarelling oppoſing-ſpirit) which beſt becomes the Goſpel, and Spirit of Chriſtianity.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Things have I written, to diſcover the weakneſs of the grounds, on which Chriſtians commonly make Diviſions; that they may ſee the weakneſs, and that there is not ſo much in the Matter as they ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: And, am willing to conclude, That if Chriſtians are not too much wedded to their own Underſtandings, it may prove of ſome help in the Matter; and that all ſorts of differing-Apprehenſions, may learn to bear with, and forbear, each other in love; and, till they can come to be of one mind, (from ſenſe of weakneſs, and fallibility,) to pity one another; and to ſeek the Peace, and Welfare of one another. This is the Lovely-ſpirit of the Goſpel; and the People, who thus walk, are a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly People; and the People, who thus walk, God will bleſs: But, if Chriſtians will ſtill go on to bite and devour each other, What can they
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:175804:52"/> expect, but to be <hi>devoured one of another?</hi> and that as a righteous Judgment from God, who is the God of Peace; and would have His People, to be the People of Peace: Therefore, if you love God, and Peace, think on theſe Things.</p>

                        <hi>1ſt.</hi> To diſcover what Unity, and Peace, it is I plead for, 1. That all who agree in the one Faith, and one Baptiſm of the Goſpel, may own each other, and walk together, in one Conſtituted-Church-Relation, (though they may differ in ſeveral diſputable Things, in matters both of Faith, and Practice;) and not by making Laws for each other, where Chriſt the Lord, and Law-giver, hath made none; that in all ſuch caſes, that Rule of the Apoſtle may be obſerved, <hi>Hast thou Faith? have it to thy ſelf:</hi> For, I am clear, there may be ſome differing-Apprehenſions, in both matters of Faith, and Practice, that ſhould make no Breach in Church-Fellowſhip: Such things as theſe, did not throw the Church into Diviſions, in purer times, than we are yet arrived to. We find that the Diſciples of Chriſt were ignorant of, and unbelieving in, the main Fundamental-Truth of the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> The Death, and Reſurrection of Chriſt; though He inſtructed them herein (at leaſt) three times, yet He ſeparated them not from Him; but owned them in what they did Believe, <hi>Matt.</hi> 16. 16, 17.

The Jews, that Believed, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe held many things in Practice about the Law; which, for Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, the Apoſtles did bear withall, and conform to, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 20, 21, 22. And lik-wiſe, the Gentile Churches had diverſities of Opinions, about Meats, Drinks, and Days, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Rom. 14. which the Apoſtle endeavours to reconcile; not by making all of one Opinion in theſe matters, but by bearing with, and forbearing each other in love: By all which, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:175804:53"/> That the greatneſs of Evil lyeth not in variety of Opinions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout many Religious things, but in making Diviſions, and Breaches, by reaſon of thoſe Opinions; and it appeareth to be a Fruit of the Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Spirit, and of the Fleſh, ſo to do.</p>
                     <p>And as for thoſe Chriſtians, who ſo far differ, either in Faith, or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; as that there cannot be Communion on a Church-account, and yet hold the Head, and prize, and preſs after Holineſs: let there be Truth of Love, allowing each other a Latitude in their way, according to their Faith, and Conſcience; elſe we do not as we would be done unto; not envying one another, nor unchriſtian one another (though there cannot be Communion in the Ordinances of Chriſt, as by Him ſtated), being not of one Mind therein; yet to encourage Godlineſs in All: and to own, and approve, what of Faith, and Truth, there is in each other; ſo far, as there is a Unity therein. For, I doubt not, but that there is ſo much of the Root of the Matter, in all gracious Perſons, as will miniſter occaſion of rejoycing in each other, if Pride, and Prejudice, be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; that ſo, there might be a free Converſe with each other, about matters of Faith and Practice.</p>
                     <p>And as for ſuch, who are Enemies, and hateful, Chriſtians ſhould ſeek Peace with ſuch, in all lawful ways; <hi>As much as in them lyeth, they ſhould live Peaceable with All,</hi> Rom. 12. 18. They ſhould love Enemies (with the Love of Pity), and pray for Enemies: This is the Will of Chriſt concerning His Church, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 44, 45. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 14, 20, 21. A Leſſon which, I fear, Chriſtians have learned but little of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>2dly.</hi> The way how to obtain this Peace; 1. Let all true Chriſtians get their Hearts principled with this: That it's their bounden-Duty, to ſtudy, ſeek, and endeavour after the Churches-Peace. Out with the ſpirit of Diviſion; and know, That it is your Duty, yea, your bounden-Duty to follow after Peace, with all the Children of Peace. For, while you entertain that Spirit (as to account all Enemies that differ from you), you will account it your Virtue to envy them, when it is but your Vice. Read and ponder, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 5. &amp; 3. 14. to 18.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Get your Hearts, not only principled with the Duty and Work; but with the Love of Chriſt, and that will effectually carry you on to the duty, &amp; work, required; if you would have your hearts filled with Love each to other, dwell deep in the Love of Chriſt to your ſelves; that is, of a humbling, melting, and transforming-Nature, and will accompliſh the Work in you, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17, 18, 19. <hi>Let the Peace of God, which paſſeth all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, keep your Hearts,</hi> and the Work will be done, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Let there be Opportunities of Converſe (in Moderation) about
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:175804:53"/> the matter; by which means, the Spirits, and Tempers of Chriſtians, may be the better known to each other; ſo (probably) the ſtumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blocks may be removed, and the end thereby obtained. The Strangneſs of Chriſtians one to another, is that which hath brought forth ſtrange, and unchriſtian-Effects: In ſome it may be, the Difference is not ſo wide as hath been ſuppoſed; and, it may be, there hath been Extreams on both hands, which Moderate-debates, might tend to rectifie.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And ſo, probably, might unite in ſuch Principles, as are neceſſary to Communion, on a Church-account: and like-wiſe, conſult what ways of Love, and Peace, may be exerciſed among all Chriſtians, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards each other; ſeeing it is the Duty of All, to love and ſeek Peace, with All that love the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall preſent ſome ſerious, and weighty Conſiderations, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to provoke all true-hearted Chriſtians, to this great, and Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concernment, of ſeeking, &amp; endeavouring, the Churches-Unity; &amp; Peace.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Remember, that the Church is yet, but coming out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and, I fear, that none of us all are ſo far removed, as to boaſt, or be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceited with our own attainments: But much of Darkneſs yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains: and, a full Deliverance, is not ſo eaſily and ſuddainly obtained, as is imagined; and, it may be, ſome have out-went their Brethren. Let us learn to pity, and pray one for another; and not judge, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure one another, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 11. Let us endeavour (every one for himſelf) to get a due ſenſe of our own Coming-ſhort; that ſo, we may judge our ſelves, and we ſhall not be ſo high in judging one another: And withal, let us remember, <hi>That we must All appear before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt.</hi> And I heartily wiſh, That there were not ſo much of the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s-Church among us, as (I fear) there is; which (I fear) is too little thought on, or laid to heart; <hi>viz. Babylon</hi>'s Pride, &amp; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, and Oppreſſion; rendring Evil for Evil, in way of revenge, back-biting, and evil-ſpeakings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O that the Church would purge it ſelf of theſe, and the like Abominations; without which, there can be no Peace with God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>2dly.</hi> Remember, (as the effect of the <hi>Babyloniſh-</hi>Darkneſs, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, that is yet upon us) that if you will not have Fellowſhip with your Brethren, but on Terms of Unity in all things; it's that which muſt neceſſarily tend, to break all Church-Communion in the World: For, ſo great are the differing-Underſtandings of Chriſtians about Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine-things, and that too, in ſome things of weighty concernment; that, I verily think, there are not two in the World, of one mind in all things: By all which, we may underſtand, How far we are from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſhould tend to humble us. And ſurely, there muſt needs be Ignorance, and Pride, where is not a ſenſe in this Matter.</p>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:175804:54"/>
                     <p> 
                        <hi>3dly.</hi> The Unity and Peace of the Godly, is that which tends much to the Honour of God, and the Goſpel The Diviſions of Chriſtians, gives occaſion to the Enemies of God to Reproach, and Religion looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the World thereby; Therefore, let all that love the Name of God, and Truth, ſtudy to find out a way for more Union, and Peace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>4thly.</hi> Love, and Peace, among the People of God, is a very lovely and deſirable thing; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. 1. <hi>Behold, how good, and how pleaſant it is for Brethren to awell together in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity:</hi> It is good before God, and pleaſant to all good men: A deſirable thing it is!</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>5thly.</hi> It's the great Goſpel-Duty of Chriſtians; for which, Chriſt prayed, and ſuffered; and Chriſtians are greatly exhorted to; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of which, is a Character of graceleſs Perſons, and a ſtate of Death, <hi>Joh</hi> 17. 20, 21. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 13, 14. &amp; 4. 1, 2, 3. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 11.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>6thly.</hi> The Diviſions of the Godly, (very probably) tend to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Converſion of poor Sinners: Is it not the common Language of many? There are ſo many Religions, and Churches, that I know not which is true, or where there be any true at all? And thus are poor ſinners wronged, by the Diviſions of profeſt Saints: See the Prayer of Chriſt in this Matter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 20, 21.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>7thly.</hi> Remember that, Diviſions, and Contentions, (ordinarily) comes from Pride, and borders on the Kingdom of the Prince of Darkneſs; who is that <hi>Envious one, who ſowed Tares among the Wheat;</hi> and will never ceaſe ſowing Diſcord among the People of God (as well as in the World) <hi>till he is ſhut up in the Bottomleſs-Pit.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>9thly.</hi> The preſent Rebukes of God, upon His People, plainly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that He is diſpleaſed with them; &amp; we have ground to judg, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the many provocations of his People, this is not the leaſt. The Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of His Heritage: His Diſpenſations (as well as His Word) call a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud to us in this matter: O let us not be like <hi>the Deaf-Adder,</hi> to ſtop our Ears at ſo many, and ſo great Calls to Peace, and Unity; Let us pray for it, and endeavour after it: <hi>O pray for the Peace of</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>They ſhall proſper who love the Peace thereof.</hi> Let there <hi>be great ſearching of Heart</hi> in this matter. Let us pray, and argue out, this foul Spirit of Diviſion. Let us ſay as the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137. 5, 6. <hi>If I forget thee,</hi>

We muſt be content to looſe our own Wills, and (it may be) our Profits, and our Honours. In ſome caſes, an Allowance muſt be yielded to each other in differing Apprehenſions, that our ſelves cannot receive. It is a juſt Liberty that every one will claim; and ſhould allow it to others, elſe we do not as we would be done by. We muſt allow each other that Liberty, <hi>as every one hath received; ſo, to walk by the ſame Rule:</hi> And let no Man reſolve to ſtand by any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>10thly.</hi> and finally; Who knows, but that wiſe and moderate Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours (in this matter), might tend to bring in a more neer Union in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral (by removing Offences, and compoſing Differences), than I have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; For, that is it we ſhould be reaching after, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
